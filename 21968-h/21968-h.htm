      HE thought he had already, poor John Berridge, tasted in their fulness the
      sweets of success; but nothing yet had been more charming to him than when
      the young Lord, as he irresistibly and, for greater certitude, quite
      correctly figured him, fairly sought out, in Paris, the new literary star
      that had begun to hang, with a fresh red light, over the vast, even though
      rather confused, Anglo-Saxon horizon; positively approaching that
      celebrity with a shy and artless appeal. The young Lord invoked on this
      occasion the celebrity&rsquo;s prized judgment of a special literary case; and
      Berridge could take the whole manner of it for one of the &ldquo;quaintest&rdquo;
       little acts displayed to his amused eyes, up to now, on the stage of
      European society&mdash;albeit these eyes were quite aware, in general, of
      missing everywhere no more of the human scene than possible, and of having
      of late been particularly awake to the large extensions of it spread
      before him (since so he could but fondly read his fate) under the omen of
      his prodigious &ldquo;hit.&rdquo; It was because of his hit that he was having rare
      opportunities&mdash;of which he was so honestly and humbly proposing, as
      he would have said, to make the most: it was because every one in the
      world (so far had the thing gone) was reading &ldquo;The Heart of Gold&rdquo; as just
      a slightly too fat volume, or sitting out the same as just a fifth-act too
      long play, that he found himself floated on a tide he would scarce have
      dared to show his favourite hero sustained by, found a hundred agreeable
      and interesting things happen to him which were all, one way or another,
      affluents of the golden stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great renewed resonance&mdash;renewed by the incredible luck of the
      play&mdash;was always in his ears without so much as a conscious turn of
      his head to listen; so that the queer world of his fame was not the mere
      usual field of the Anglo-Saxon boom, but positively the bottom of the
      whole theatric sea, unplumbed source of the wave that had borne him in the
      course of a year or two over German, French, Italian, Russian,
      Scandinavian foot-lights. Paris itself really appeared for the hour the
      centre of his cyclone, with reports and &ldquo;returns,&rdquo; to say nothing of
      agents and emissaries, converging from the minor capitals; though his
      impatience was scarce the less keen to get back to London, where his work
      had had no such critical excoriation to survive, no such lesson of anguish
      to learn, as it had received at the hand of supreme authority, of that
      French authority which was in such a matter the only one to be
      artistically reckoned with. If his spirit indeed had had to reckon with it
      his fourth act practically hadn&rsquo;t: it continued to make him blush every
      night for the public more even than the inimitable <i>feuilleton</i> had
      made him blush for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This had figured, however, after all, the one bad drop in his cup; so
      that, for the rest, his high-water mark might well have been, that evening
      at Gloriani&rsquo;s studio, the approach of his odd and charming applicant,
      vaguely introduced at the latter&rsquo;s very own request by their hostess, who,
      with an honest, helpless, genial gesture, washed her fat begemmed hands of
      the name and identity of either, but left the fresh, fair, ever so
      habitually assured, yet ever so easily awkward Englishman with his plea to
      put forth. There was that in this pleasant personage which could still
      make Berridge wonder what conception of profit from him might have, all
      incalculably, taken form in such a head&mdash;these being truly the last
      intrenchments of our hero&rsquo;s modesty. He wondered, the splendid young man,
      he wondered awfully, he wondered (it was unmistakable) quite nervously, he
      wondered, to John&rsquo;s ardent and acute imagination, quite beautifully, if
      the author of &ldquo;The Heart of Gold&rdquo; would mind just looking at a book by a
      friend of his, a great friend, which he himself believed rather clever,
      and had in fact found very charming, but as to which&mdash;if it really
      wouldn&rsquo;t bore Mr. Berridge&mdash;he should so like the verdict of some one
      who knew. His friend was awfully ambitious, and he thought there was
      something in it&mdash;with all of which might he send the book to any
      address?
    </p>
    <p>
      Berridge thought of many things while the young Lord thus charged upon
      him, and it was odd that no one of them was any question of the possible
      worth of the offered achievement&mdash;which, for that matter, was certain
      to be of the quality of <i>all</i> the books, to say nothing of the plays,
      and the projects for plays, with which, for some time past, he had seen
      his daily post-bag distended. He had made out, on looking at these things,
      no difference at all from one to the other. Here, however, was something
      more&mdash;something that made his fellow-guest&rsquo;s overture <i>independently</i>
      interesting and, as he might imagine, important. He smiled, he was
      friendly and vague; said &ldquo;A work of fiction, I suppose?&rdquo; and that he
      didn&rsquo;t pretend ever to pronounce, that he in fact quite hated, always, to
      have to, not &ldquo;knowing,&rdquo; as he felt, any better than any one else; but
      would gladly look at anything, under that demur, if it would give any
      pleasure. Perhaps the very brightest and most diamond-like twinkle he had
      yet seen the star of his renown emit was just the light brought into his
      young Lord&rsquo;s eyes by this so easy consent to oblige. It was easy because
      the presence before him was from moment to moment, referring itself back
      to some recent observation or memory; something caught somewhere, within a
      few weeks or months, as he had moved about, and that seemed to flutter
      forth at this stir of the folded leaves of his recent experience very much
      as a gathered, faded flower, placed there for &ldquo;pressing,&rdquo; might drop from
      between the pages of a volume opened at hazard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had seen him before, this splendid and sympathetic person&mdash;whose
      flattering appeal was by no means <i>all</i> that made him sympathetic; he
      had met him, had noted, had wondered about him, had in fact imaginatively,
      intellectually, so to speak, quite yearned over him, in some conjunction
      lately, though ever so fleet-ingly, apprehended: which circumstance
      constituted precisely an association as tormenting, for the few minutes,
      as it was vague, and set him to sounding, intensely and vainly, the face
      that itself figured everything agreeable except recognition. He couldn&rsquo;t
      remember, and the young man didn&rsquo;t; distinctly, yes, they had been in
      presence, during the previous winter, by some chance of travel, through
      Sicily, through Italy, through the south of France, but his <i>Seigneurie</i>&mdash;so
      Berridge liked exotically to phrase it&mdash;had then (in ignorance of the
      present reasons) not noticed <i>him</i>. It was positive for the man of
      established identity, all the while too, and through the perfect lucidity
      of his sense of achievement in an air &ldquo;conducting&rdquo; nothing but the loudest
      bang, that this was fundamentally much less remarkable than the fact of
      his being made up to in such a quarter now. That was the disservice, in a
      manner, of one&rsquo;s having so much imagination: the mysterious values of
      other types kept looming larger before you than the doubtless often higher
      but comparatively familiar ones of your own, and if you had anything of
      the artist&rsquo;s real feeling for life the attraction and amusement of
      possibilities so projected were worth more to you, in nineteen moods out
      of twenty, than the sufficiency, the serenity, the felicity, whatever it
      might be, of your stale personal certitudes. You were intellectually, you
      were &ldquo;artistically&rdquo; rather abject, in fine, if your curiosity (in the
      grand sense of the term) wasn&rsquo;t worth more to you than your dignity. What
      was your dignity, &ldquo;anyway,&rdquo; but just the consistency of your curiosity,
      and what moments were ever so ignoble for you as, under the blighting
      breath of the false gods, stupid conventions, traditions, examples, your
      lapses from that consistency? His <i>Seigneurie</i>, at all events,
      delightfully, hadn&rsquo;t the least real idea of what any John Berridge was
      talking about, and the latter felt that if he had been less beautifully
      witless, and thereby less true to his right figure, it might scarce have
      been forgiven him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His right figure was that of life in irreflective joy and at the highest
      thinkable level of prepared security and unconscious insolence. What was
      the pale page of fiction compared with the intimately personal adventure
      that, in almost any direction, he would have been all so stupidly, all so
      gallantly, all so instinctively and, by every presumption, so prevailingly
      ready for? Berridge would have given six months&rsquo; &ldquo;royalties&rdquo; for even an
      hour of his looser dormant consciousness&mdash;since one was oneself,
      after all, no worm, but an heir of all the ages too&mdash;and yet without
      being able to supply chapter and verse for the felt, the huge difference.
      His <i>Seigneurie</i> was tall and straight, but so, thank goodness, was
      the author of &ldquo;The Heart of Gold,&rdquo; who had no such vulgar &ldquo;mug&rdquo; either;
      and there was no intrinsic inferiority in being a bit inordinately, and so
      it might have seemed a bit strikingly, black-browed instead of being fair
      as the morning. Again while his new friend delivered himself our own tried
      in vain to place him; he indulged in plenty of pleasant, if rather
      restlessly headlong sound, the confessed incoherence of a happy mortal who
      had always many things &ldquo;on,&rdquo; and who, while waiting at any moment for
      connections and consummations, had fallen into the way of talking, as they
      said, all artlessly, and a trifle more betrayingly, against time. He would
      always be having appointments, and somehow of a high &ldquo;romantic&rdquo; order, to
      keep, and the imperfect punctualities of others to wait for&mdash;though
      who would be of a quality to make such a pampered personage wait very much
      our young analyst could only enjoy asking himself. There were women who
      might be of a quality&mdash;half a dozen of those perhaps, of those alone,
      about the world; our friend was as sure of this, by the end of four
      minutes, as if he knew all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After saying he would send him the book the young Lord indeed dropped that
      subject; he had asked where he might send it, and had had an &ldquo;Oh, I shall
      remember!&rdquo; on John&rsquo;s mention of an hotel; but he had made no further dash
      into literature, and it was ten to one that this would be the last the
      distinguished author might hear of the volume. Such again was a note of
      these high existences&mdash;that made one content to ask of them no whit
      of other consistency than that of carrying off the particular occasion,
      whatever it might be, in a dazzle of amiability and felicity and leaving
      <i>that</i> as a sufficient trace of their passage. Sought and achieved
      consistency was but an angular, a secondary motion; compared with the air
      of complete freedom it might have an effect of deformity. There was no
      placing this figure of radiant ease, for Berridge, in any relation that
      didn&rsquo;t appear not good enough&mdash;that is among the relations that
      hadn&rsquo;t been too good for Berridge himself. He was all right where he was;
      the great Gloriani somehow made that law; his house, with his supreme
      artistic position, was good enough for any one, and to-night in especial
      there were charming people, more charming than our friend could recall
      from any other scene, as the natural train or circle, as he might say, of
      such a presence. For an instant he thought he had got the face as a
      specimen of imperturbability watched, with wonder, across the hushed
      rattle of roulette at Monte-Carlo; but this quickly became as improbable
      as any question of a vulgar <i>table d&rsquo;hote</i>, or a steam-boat deck, or
      a herd of fellow-pilgrims cicerone-led, or even an opera-box serving,
      during a performance, for frame of a type observed from the stalls. One
      placed young gods and goddesses only when one placed them on Olympus, and
      it met the case, always, that they were of Olympian race, and that they
      glimmered for one, at the best, through their silver cloud, like the
      visiting apparitions in an epic.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was brief and beautiful indeed till something happened that gave it,
      for Berridge, on the spot, a prodigious extension&mdash;an extension
      really as prodigious, after a little, as if he had suddenly seen the
      silver clouds multiply and then the whole of Olympus presently open.
      Music, breaking upon the large air, enjoined immediate attention, and in a
      moment he was listening, with the rest of the company, to an eminent
      tenor, who stood by the piano; and was aware, with it, that his Englishman
      had turned away and that in the vast, rich, tapestried room where, in
      spite of figures and objects so numerous, clear spaces, wide vistas, and,
      as they might be called, becoming situations abounded, there had been from
      elsewhere, at the signal of unmistakable song, a rapid accession of
      guests. At first he but took this in, and the way that several young
      women, for whom seats had been found, looked charming in the rapt
      attitude; while even the men, mostly standing and grouped, &ldquo;composed,&rdquo; in
      their stillness, scarce less impressively, under the sway of the divine
      voice. It ruled the scene, to the last intensity, and yet our young man&rsquo;s
      fine sense found still a resource in the range of the eyes, without sound
      or motion, while all the rest of consciousness was held down as by a hand
      mailed in silver. It was better, in this way, than the opera&mdash;John
      alertly thought of that: the composition sung might be Wagnerian, but no
      Tristram, no Iseult, no Parsifal and, no Kundry of them all could ever
      show, could ever &ldquo;act&rdquo; to the music, as our friend had thus the power of
      seeing his dear contemporaries of either sex (armoured <i>they</i> so
      otherwise than in cheap Teutonic tinsel!) just continuously and
      inscrutably sit to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It made, the whole thing together, an enchantment amid which he had in
      truth, at a given moment, ceased to distinguish parts&mdash;so that he was
      himself certainly at last soaring as high as the singer&rsquo;s voice and
      forgetting, in a lost gaze at the splendid ceiling, everything of the
      occasion but what his intelligence poured into it. This, as happened, was
      a flight so sublime that by the time he had dropped his eyes again a
      cluster of persons near the main door had just parted to give way to a
      belated lady who slipped in, through the gap made for her, and stood for
      some minutes full in his view. It was a proof of the perfect hush that no
      one stirred to offer her a seat, and her entrance, in her high grace, had
      yet been so noiseless that she could remain at once immensely exposed and
      completely unabashed. For Berridge, once more, if the scenic show before
      him so melted into the music, here precisely might have been the heroine
      herself advancing to the foot-lights at her cue. The interest deepened to
      a thrill, and everything, at the touch of his recognition of this
      personage, absolutely the most beautiful woman now present, fell
      exquisitely together and gave him what he had been wanting from the moment
      of his taking in his young Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was there, the missing connection: her arrival had on the instant
      lighted it by a flash. Olympian herself, supremely, divinely Olympian, she
      had arrived, could <i>only</i> have arrived, for the one person present of
      really equal race, our young man&rsquo;s late converser, whose flattering
      demonstration might now stand for one of the odd extravagant forms taken
      by nervous impatience. This charming, this dazzling woman had been one
      member of the couple disturbed, to his intimate conviction, the autumn
      previous, on his being pushed by the officials, at the last moment, into a
      compartment of the train that was to take him from Cremona to Mantua&mdash;where,
      failing a stop, he had had to keep his place. The other member, by whose
      felt but unseized identity he had been haunted, was the unconsciously
      insolent form of guaranteed happiness he had just been engaged with. The
      sense of the admirable intimacy that, having taken its precautions, had
      not reckoned with his irruption&mdash;this image had remained with him; to
      say nothing of the interest of aspect of the associated figures, so
      stamped somehow with rarity, so beautifully distinct from the common
      occupants of padded corners, and yet on the subject of whom, for the
      romantic structure he was immediately to raise, he had not had a scrap of
      evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had imputed to them conditions it was all his own doing: it came
      from his inveterate habit of abysmal imputation, the snatching of the ell
      wherever the inch peeped out, without which where would have been the
      tolerability of life? It didn&rsquo;t matter now what he had imputed&mdash;and
      he always held that his expenses of imputation were, at the worst, a
      compliment to those inspiring them. It only mattered that each of the pair
      had been then what he really saw each now&mdash;full, that is, of the
      pride of their youth and beauty and fortune and freedom, though at the
      same time particularly preoccupied: preoccupied, that is, with the
      affairs, and above all with the passions, of Olympus. Who had they been,
      and what? Whence had they come, whither were they bound, what tie united
      them, what adventure engaged, what felicity, tempered by what peril,
      magnificently, dramatically attended? These had been his questions, all so
      inevitable and so impertinent, at the time, and to the exclusion of any
      scruples over his not postulating an inane honeymoon, his not taking the
      &ldquo;tie,&rdquo; as he should doubtless properly have done, for the mere blest
      matrimonial; and he now retracted not one of them, flushing as they did
      before him again with their old momentary life. To feel his two friends
      renewedly in presence&mdash;friends of the fleeting hour though they had
      but been, and with whom he had exchanged no sign save the vaguest of
      salutes on finally relieving them of his company&mdash;was only to be
      conscious that he hadn&rsquo;t, on the spot, done them, so to speak, half
      justice, and that, for his superior entertainment, there would be ever so
      much more of them to come.

    <p>
      It might already have been coming indeed, with an immense stride, when,
      scarce more than ten minutes later, he was aware that the distinguished
      stranger had brought the Princess straight across the room to speak to
      him. He had failed in the interval of any glimpse of their closer meeting;
      for the great tenor had sung another song and then stopped, immediately on
      which Madame Gloriani had made his pulse quicken to a different, if not to
      a finer, throb by hovering before him once more with the man in the world
      he most admired, as it were, looking at him over her shoulder. The man in
      the world he most admired, the greatest then of contemporary Dramatists&mdash;and
      bearing, independently, the name inscribed if not in deepest incision at
      least in thickest gilding on the rich recreative roll&mdash;this
      prodigious personage was actually to suffer &ldquo;presentation&rdquo; to him at the
      good lady&rsquo;s generous but ineffectual hands, and had in fact the next
      instant, left alone with him, bowed, in formal salutation, the massive,
      curly, witty head, so &ldquo;romantic&rdquo; yet so modern, so &ldquo;artistic&rdquo; and ironic
      yet somehow so civic, so Gallic yet somehow so cosmic, his personal vision
      of which had not hitherto transcended that of the possessor of a signed
      and framed photograph in a consecrated quarter of a writing-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was positive, however, that poor John was afterward to remember of this
      conjunction nothing whatever but the fact of the great man&rsquo;s looking at
      him very hard, straight in the eyes, and of his not having himself
      scrupled to do as much, and with a confessed intensity of appetite. It was
      improbable, he was to recognise, that they had, for the few minutes, only
      stared and grimaced, like pitted boxers or wrestlers; but what had abode
      with him later on, none the less, was just the cherished memory of his not
      having so lost presence of mind as to fail of feeding on his impression.
      It was precious and precarious, that was perhaps all there would be of it;
      and his subsequent consciousness was quite to cherish this queer view of
      the silence, neither awkward nor empty nor harsh, but on the contrary
      quite charged and brimming, that represented for him his use, his
      unforgettable enjoyment in fact, of his opportunity. Had nothing passed in
      words? Well, no misery of murmured &ldquo;homage,&rdquo; thank goodness; though
      something must have been said, certainly, to lead up, as they put it at
      the theatre, to John&rsquo;s having asked the head of the profession, before
      they separated, if he by chance knew who the so radiantly handsome young
      woman might be, the one who had so lately come in and who wore the pale
      yellow dress, of the strange tone, and the magnificent pearls. They must
      have separated soon, it was further to have been noted; since it was
      before the advance of the pair, their wonderful dazzling charge upon him,
      that he had distinctly seen the great man, at a distance again, block out
      from his sight the harmony of the faded gold and the pearls&mdash;to speak
      only of that&mdash;and plant himself there (the mere high Atlas-back of
      renown to Berridge now) as for communion with them. He had blocked
      everything out, to this tune, effectually; with nothing of the matter left
      for our friend meanwhile but that, as he had said, the beautiful lady was
      the Princess. What Princess, or the Princess of what?&mdash;our young man
      had afterward wondered; his companion&rsquo;s reply having lost itself in the
      prelude of an outburst by another vocalist who had approached the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after these things that she so incredibly came to him, attended by
      her adorer&mdash;since he took it for absolute that the young Lord was her
      adorer, as who indeed mightn&rsquo;t be?&mdash;and scarce waiting, in her bright
      simplicity, for any form of introduction. It may thus be said in a word
      that this was the manner in which she made our hero&rsquo;s acquaintance, a
      satisfaction that she on the spot described to him as really wanting of
      late to her felicity. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read everything, you know, and &lsquo;The Heart of
      Gold&rsquo; three times&rdquo;: she put it all immediately on that ground, while the
      young Lord now smiled, beside her, as if it were quite the sort of thing
      he had done too; and while, further, the author of the work yielded to the
      consciousness that whereas in general he had come at last scarce to be
      able to bear the iteration of those words, which affected him as a mere
      vain vocal convulsion, so not a breath of this association now attended
      them, so such a person as the Princess could make of them what she would.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless it was to be really what <i>he</i> would!&mdash;this occurred to
      him in the very thick of the prodigy, no single shade of possibility of
      which was less prodigious than any other. It was a declaration, simply,
      the admirable young woman was treating him to, a profession of &ldquo;artistic
      sympathy&rdquo;&mdash;for she was in a moment to use this very term that made
      for them a large, clear, common ether, an element all uplifted and rare,
      of which they could equally partake.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she was Olympian&mdash;as in her rich and regular young beauty, that of
      some divine Greek mask over-painted say by Titian, she more and more
      appeared to him&mdash;this offered air was that of the gods themselves:
      she might have been, with her long rustle across the room, Artemis
      decorated, hung with pearls, for her worshippers, yet disconcerting them
      by having, under an impulse just faintly fierce, snatched the cup of gold
      from Hebe. It was to him, John Berridge, she thus publicly offered it; and
      it was his over-topping <i>confrere</i> of shortly before who was the
      worshipper most disconcerted. John had happened to catch, even at its
      distance, after these friends had joined him, the momentary deep, grave
      estimate, in the great Dramatist&rsquo;s salient watching eyes, of the
      Princess&rsquo;s so singular performance: the touch perhaps this, in the whole
      business, that made Berridge&rsquo;s sense of it most sharp. The sense of it as
      <i>prodigy</i> didn&rsquo;t in the least entail his feeling abject&mdash;any
      more, that is, than in the due dazzled degree; for surely there would have
      been supreme wonder in the eagerness of her exchange of mature glory for
      thin notoriety, hadn&rsquo;t it still exceeded everything that an Olympian of
      such race should have found herself bothered, as they said, to &ldquo;read&rdquo; at
      all&mdash;and most of all to read three times!
    </p>
    <p>
      With the turn the matter took as an effect of this meeting, Berridge was
      more than once to find himself almost ashamed for her&mdash;since it
      seemed never to occur to her to be so for herself: he was jealous of the
      type where she might have been taken as insolently careless of it; his
      advantage (unless indeed it had been his ruin) being that he could
      inordinately reflect upon it, could wander off thereby into kinds of
      licence of which she was incapable. He hadn&rsquo;t, for himself, waited till
      now to be sure of what he would do were <i>he</i> an Olympian: he would
      leave his own stuff snugly unread, to begin with; that would be a
      beautiful start for an Olympian career. He should have been as unable to
      write those works in short as to make anything else of them; and he should
      have had no more arithmetic for computing fingers than any perfect-headed
      marble Apollo mutilated at the wrists. He should have consented to know
      but the grand personal adventure on the grand personal basis: nothing
      short of this, no poor cognisance of confusable, pettifogging things, the
      sphere of earth-grubbing questions and two-penny issues, would begin to
      be, on any side, Olympian enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the great Dramatist, with his tempered and tested steel and his
      immense &ldquo;assured&rdquo; position, even he was not Olympian: the look, full of
      the torment of earth, with which he had seen the Princess turn her back,
      and for such a purpose, on the prized privilege of his notice, testified
      sufficiently to that. Still, comparatively, it was to be said, the
      question of a personal relation with an authority so eminent on the
      subject of the passions&mdash;to say nothing of the rest of his charm&mdash;might
      have had for an ardent young woman (and the Princess was unmistakably
      ardent) the absolute attraction of romance: unless, again, prodigy of
      prodigies, she were looking for her romance very particularly elsewhere.
      Yet where could she have been looking for it, Berridge was to ask himself
      with private intensity, in a manner to leave her so at her ease for
      appearing to offer <i>him</i> everything?&mdash;so free to be quite
      divinely gentle with him, to hover there before him in all her mild,
      bright, smooth sublimity and to say: &ldquo;I should be so very grateful if
      you&rsquo;d come to see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There succeeded this a space of time of which he was afterward to lose all
      account, was never to recover the history; his only coherent view of it
      being that an interruption, some incident that kept them a while separate,
      had then taken place, yet that during their separation, of half an hour or
      whatever, they had still somehow not lost sight of each other, but had
      found their eyes meeting, in deep communion, all across the great peopled
      room; meeting and wanting to meet, wanting&mdash;it was the most
      extraordinary thing in the world for the suppression of stages, for
      confessed precipitate intensity&mdash;to use together every instant of the
      hour that might be left them. Yet to use it for what?&mdash;unless, like
      beautiful fabulous figures in some old-world legend, for the frankest and
      almost the crudest avowal of the impression they had made on each other.
      He couldn&rsquo;t have named, later on, any other person she had during this
      space been engaged with, any more than he was to remember in the least
      what he had himself ostensibly done, who had spoken to him, whom he had
      spoken to, or whether he hadn&rsquo;t just stood and publicly gaped or
      languished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, Olympians were unconventional indeed&mdash;that was a part of their
      high bravery and privilege; but what it also appeared to attest in this
      wondrous manner was that they could communicate to their chosen in three
      minutes, by the mere light of their eyes, the same shining cynicism. He
      was to wonder of course, tinglingly enough, whether he had really made an
      ass of himself, and there was this amount of evidence for it that there
      certainly <i>had</i> been a series of moments each one of which glowed
      with the lucid sense that, as she couldn&rsquo;t like him as much as <i>that</i>
      either for his acted clap-trap or for his printed verbiage, what it must
      come to was that she liked him, and to such a tune, just for himself and
      quite after no other fashion than that in which every goddess in the
      calendar had, when you came to look, sooner or later liked some
      prepossessing young shepherd. The question would thus have been, for him,
      with a still sharper eventual ache, of whether he positively <i>had</i>,
      as an effect of the miracle, been petrified, before fifty pair of eyes, to
      the posture of a prepossessing shepherd&mdash;and would perhaps have left
      him under the shadow of some such imputable fatuity if his consciousness
      hadn&rsquo;t, at a given moment, cleared up to still stranger things.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agent of the change was, as quite congruously happened, none other
      than the shining youth whom he now seemed to himself to have been thinking
      of for ever so long, for a much longer time than he had ever in his life
      spent at an evening party, as the young Lord: which personage suddenly
      stood before him again, holding him up an odd object and smiling, as if in
      reference to it, with a gladness that at once struck our friend as almost
      too absurd for belief. The object was incongruous by reason of its being,
      to a second and less preoccupied glance, a book; and what had befallen
      Berridge within twenty minutes was that they&mdash;the Princess and he,
      that is&mdash;had got such millions of miles, or at least such thousands
      of years, away from <i>those</i> platitudes. The book, he found himself
      assuming, could only be <i>his</i> book (it seemed also to have a tawdry
      red cover); and there came to him memories, dreadfully false notes sounded
      so straight again by his new acquaintance, of certain altogether different
      persons who at certain altogether different parties had flourished volumes
      before him very much with that insinuating gesture, that arch expression,
      and that fell intention. The meaning of these things&mdash;of all possible
      breaks of the charm at such an hour!&mdash;was that he should &ldquo;signature&rdquo;
       the ugly thing, and with a characteristic quotation or sentiment: that was
      the way people simpered and squirmed, the way they mouthed and beckoned,
      when animated by such purposes; and it already, on the spot, almost broke
      his heart to see such a type as that of the young Lord brought, by the
      vulgarest of fashions, so low. This state of quick displeasure in
      Berridge, however, was founded on a deeper question&mdash;the question of
      how in the world he was to remain for himself a prepossessing shepherd if
      he should consent to come back to these base actualities. It was true that
      even while this wonderment held him, his aggressor&rsquo;s perfect good
      conscience had placed the matter in a slightly different light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By an extraordinary chance I&rsquo;ve found a copy of my friend&rsquo;s novel on one
      of the tables here&mdash;I see by the inscription that she has presented
      it to Gloriani. So if you&rsquo;d like to glance at it&mdash;!&rdquo; And the young
      Lord, in the pride of his association with the eminent thing, held it out
      to Berridge as artlessly as if it had been a striking natural specimen of
      some sort, a rosy round apple grown in his own orchard, or an exceptional
      precious stone, to be admired for its weight and lustre. Berridge accepted
      the offer mechanically&mdash;relieved at the prompt fading of his worst
      fear, yet feeling in himself a tell-tale facial blankness for the still
      absolutely anomalous character of his friend&rsquo;s appeal. He was even tempted
      for a moment to lay the volume down without looking at it&mdash;only with
      some extemporised promise to borrow it of their host and take it home, to
      give himself to it at an easier moment. Then the very expression of his
      fellow-guests own countenance determined in him a different and a still
      more dreadful view; in fact an immediate collapse of the dream in which he
      had for the splendid previous space of time been living. The young Lord
      himself, in his radiant costly barbarism, figured far better than John
      Berridge could do the prepossessing shepherd, the beautiful mythological
      mortal &ldquo;distinguished&rdquo; by a goddess; for our hero now saw that his whole
      manner of dealing with his ridiculous tribute was marked exactly by the
      grand simplicity, the prehistoric good faith, as one might call it, of
      far-off romantic and &ldquo;plastic&rdquo; creatures, figures of exquisite Arcadian
      stamp, glorified rustics like those of the train of peasants in &ldquo;A
      Winter&rsquo;s Tale,&rdquo; who thought nothing of such treasure-trove, on a Claude
      Lorrain sea-strand, as a royal infant wrapped in purple: something in that
      fabulous style of exhibition appearing exactly what his present
      demonstration might have been prompted by. &ldquo;The Top of the Tree, by Amy
      Evans&rdquo;&mdash;scarce credible words floating before Berridge after he had
      with an anguish of effort dropped his eyes on the importunate title-page&mdash;represented
      an object as alien to the careless grace of goddess-haunted Arcady as a
      washed-up &ldquo;kodak&rdquo; from a wrecked ship might have been to the appreciation
      of some islander of wholly unvisited seas. Nothing could have been more in
      the tone of an islander deplorably diverted from his native interests and
      dignities than the glibness with which John&rsquo;s own child of nature went on.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s her pen-name, Amy Evans&rdquo;&mdash;he couldn&rsquo;t have said it otherwise
      had he been a blue-chinned penny-a-liner; yet marking it with a
      disconnectedness of intelligence that kept up all the poetry of his own
      situation and only crashed into that of other persons. The reference put
      the author of &ldquo;The Heart of Gold&rdquo; quite into <i>his</i> place, but left
      the speaker absolutely free of Arcady. &ldquo;Thanks awfully&rdquo;&mdash;Berridge
      somehow clutched at that, to keep everything from swimming. &ldquo;Yes, I should
      like to look at it,&rdquo; he managed, horribly grimacing now, he believed, to
      say; and there was in fact a strange short interlude after this in which
      he scarce knew what had become of any one or of anything; in which he only
      seemed to himself to stand alone in a desolate place where even its
      desolation didn&rsquo;t save him from having to stare at the greyest of printed
      pages. Nothing here helped anything else, since the stamped greyness
      didn&rsquo;t even in itself make it impossible his eyes should follow such
      sentences as: &ldquo;The loveliness of the face, which was that of the glorious
      period in which Pheidias reigned supreme, and which owed its most
      exquisite note to that shell-like curl of the upper lip which always
      somehow recalls for us the smile with which windblown Astarte must have
      risen from the salt sea to which she owed her birth and her terrible
      moods; or it was too much for all the passionate woman in her, and she let
      herself go, over the flowering land that had been, but was no longer their
      love, with an effect of blighting desolation that might have proceeded
      from one of the more physical, though not more awful, convulsions of
      nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to know later on that other and much more natural things had
      occurred; as that, for instance, with now at last a definite intermission
      of the rare music that for a long time past, save at the briefest
      intervals, had kept all participants ostensibly attentive and motionless,
      and that in spite of its high quality and the supposed privilege of
      listening to it he had allowed himself not to catch a note of, there was a
      great rustling and shifting and vociferous drop to a lower plane, more
      marked still with the quick clearance of a way to supper and a lively
      dispersal of most of the guests. Hadn&rsquo;t he made out, through the queer
      glare of appearances, though they yet somehow all came to him as confused
      and unreal, that the Princess was no longer there, wasn&rsquo;t even only
      crowded out of his range by the immediate multiplication of her court, the
      obsequious court that the change of pitch had at once permitted to close
      round her; that Gloriani had offered her his arm, in a gallant official
      way, as to the greatest lady present, and that he was left with half a
      dozen persons more knowing than the others, who had promptly taken, singly
      or in couples, to a closer inspection of the fine small scattered
      treasures of the studio?
    </p>
    <p>
      He himself stood there, rueful and stricken, nursing a silly red-bound
      book under his arm very much as if he might have been holding on tight to
      an upright stake, or to the nearest piece of furniture, during some
      impression of a sharp earthquake-shock or of an attack of dyspeptic
      dizziness; albeit indeed that he wasn&rsquo;t conscious of this absurd, this
      instinctive nervous clutch till the thing that was to be more wonderful
      than any yet suddenly flared up for him&mdash;the sight of the Princess
      again on the threshold of the room, poised there an instant, in her
      exquisite grace, for recovery of some one or of something, and then, at
      recognition of him, coming straight to him across the empty place as if he
      alone, and nobody and nothing else, were what she incredibly wanted. She
      was there, she was radiantly <i>at</i> him, as if she had known and loved
      him for ten years&mdash;ten years during which, however, she had never
      quite been able, in spite of undiscouraged attempts, to cure him, as
      goddesses <i>had</i> to cure shepherds, of his mere mortal shyness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah no, not <i>that</i> one!&rdquo; she said at once, with her divine
      familiarity; for she had in the flash of an eye &ldquo;spotted&rdquo; the particular
      literary production he seemed so very fondly to have possessed himself of
      and against which all the Amy Evans in her, as she would doubtless have
      put it, clearly wished on the spot to discriminate. She pulled it away
      from him; he let it go; he scarce knew what was happening&mdash;only made
      out that she distinguished the right one, the one that should have been
      shown him, as blue or green or purple, and intimated that her other
      friend, her fellow-Olympian, as Berridge had thought of him from the
      first, really did too clumsily bungle matters, poor dear, with his
      officiousness over the red one! She went on really as if she had come for
      that, some such rectification, some such eagerness of reunion with dear
      Mr. Berridge, some talk, after all the tiresome music, of questions really
      urgent; while, thanks to the supreme strangeness of it, the high tide of
      golden fable floated him afresh, and her pretext and her plea, the
      queerness of her offered motive, melted away after the fashion of the
      enveloping clouds that do their office in epics and idylls. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t
      perhaps know I&rsquo;m Amy Evans,&rdquo; she smiled, &ldquo;or even perhaps that I write in
      English&mdash;which I love, I assure you, as much as you can yourself do,
      and which gives one (doesn&rsquo;t it? for who should know if not you?) the
      biggest of publics. I &lsquo;just love&rsquo;&mdash;don&rsquo;t they say?&mdash;your
      American millions; and all the more that they really <i>take</i> me for
      Amy Evans, as I&rsquo;ve just wanted to be taken, to be loved too for myself,
      don&rsquo;t you know?&mdash;that they haven&rsquo;t seemed to try at all to &lsquo;go
      behind&rsquo; (don&rsquo;t you say?) my poor dear little <i>nom de guerre</i>. But
      it&rsquo;s the new one, my last, &lsquo;The Velvet Glove,&rsquo; that I should like you to
      judge me by&mdash;if such a <i>corvee</i> isn&rsquo;t too horrible for you to
      think of; though I admit it&rsquo;s a move straight in the romantic direction&mdash;since
      after all (for I might as well make a clean breast of it) it&rsquo;s dear old
      discredited romance that I&rsquo;m most in sympathy with. I&rsquo;ll send you &lsquo;The
      Velvet Glove&rsquo; to-morrow, if you <i>can</i> find half an hour for it; and
      then&mdash;and <i>then</i>&mdash;!&rdquo; She paused as for the positive bright
      glory of her meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      It could only be so extraordinary, her meaning, whatever it was, that the
      need in him that would&mdash;whatever it was again!&mdash;meet it most
      absolutely formed the syllables on his lips as: &ldquo;Will you be very, <i>very</i>
      kind to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah &lsquo;kind,&rsquo; dear Mr. Berridge? &lsquo;Kind,&rsquo;&rdquo; she splendidly laughed, &ldquo;is
      nothing to what&mdash;!&rdquo; But she pulled herself up again an instant.
      &ldquo;Well, to what I want to be! Just <i>see</i>,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how I want to
      be!&rdquo; It was exactly, he felt, what he couldn&rsquo;t <i>but</i> see&mdash;in
      spite of books and publics and pen-names, in spite of the really
      &ldquo;decadent&rdquo; perversity, recalling that of the most irresponsibly insolent
      of the old Romans and Byzantines, that could lead a creature so formed for
      living and breathing her Romance, and so committed, up to the eyes, to the
      constant fact of her personal immersion in it and genius for it, the
      dreadful amateurish dance of ungrammatically scribbling it, with editions
      and advertisements and reviews and royalties and every other futile item:
      since what was more of the deep essence of throbbing intercourse itself
      than this very act of her having broken away from people, in the other
      room, to whom he was as nought, of her having, with her <i>crânerie</i> of
      audacity and indifference, just turned her back on them all as soon as she
      had begun to miss him? What was more of it than her having forbidden them,
      by a sufficient curt ring of her own supremely silver tone, to attempt to
      check or criticise her freedom, than her having looked him up, at his
      distance, under all the noses he had put out of joint, so as to let them
      think whatever they might&mdash;not of herself (much she troubled to
      care!) but of the new champion to be reckoned with, the invincible young
      lion of the day? What was more of it in short than her having perhaps even
      positively snubbed for him the great mystified Sculptor and the great
      bewildered Dramatist, treated to this queer experience for the first time
      of their lives?
    </p>
    <p>
      It all came back again to the really great ease of really great ladies,
      and to the perfect facility of everything when once they were great
      enough. <i>That</i> might become the delicious thing to him, he more and
      more felt, as soon as it should be supremely attested; it was ground he
      had ventured on, scenically, representation-ally, in the artistic sphere,
      but without ever dreaming he should &ldquo;realise&rdquo; it thus in the social.
      Handsomely, gallantly just now, moreover, he didn&rsquo;t so much as let it
      occur to him that the social experience would perhaps on some future
      occasion richly profit further scenic efforts; he only lost himself in the
      consciousness of all she invited him to believe. It took licence, this
      consciousness, the next moment, for a tremendous further throb, from what
      she had gone on to say to him in so many words&mdash;though indeed the
      words were nothing and it was all a matter but of the implication that
      glimmered through them: &ldquo;Do you <i>want</i> very much your supper here?&rdquo;
       And then while he felt himself glare, for charmed response, almost to the
      point of his tears rising with it: &ldquo;Because if you don&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because if I don&rsquo;t&mdash;?&rdquo; She had paused, not from the faintest shade
      of timidity, but clearly for the pleasure of making him press.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t we go together, letting me drive you home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come home with me?&rdquo; gasped John Berridge while the perspiration on
      his brow might have been the morning dew on a high lawn of Mount Ida.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;you had better come with <i>me</i>. That&rsquo;s what I mean; but I
      certainly will come to you with pleasure some time if you&rsquo;ll let me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no more than that of the most fatuous of freedoms, as he felt
      directly he had spoken that it might have seemed to her; and before he had
      even time to welcome the relief of not having then himself, for beastly
      contrition, to make more of it, she had simply mentioned, with her
      affectionate ease, that she wanted to get away, that of the bores there
      she might easily, after a little, have too much, and that if he&rsquo;d but say
      the word they&rsquo;d nip straight out together by an independent door and be
      sure to find her motor in the court. What word he had found to say, he was
      afterward to reflect, must have little enough mattered; for he was to have
      kept, of what then occurred, but a single other impression, that of her
      great fragrant rustle beside him over the rest of the ample room and
      toward their nearest and friendliest resource, the door by which he had
      come in and which gave directly upon a staircase. This independent image
      was just that of the only other of his fellow-guests with whom he had been
      closely concerned; he had thought of him rather indeed, up to that moment,
      as the Princess&rsquo;s fellow-Olympian&mdash;but a new momentary vision of him
      seemed now to qualify it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Lord had reappeared within a minute on the threshold, that of
      the passage from the supper-room, lately crossed by the Princess herself,
      and Berridge felt him there, saw him there, wondered about him there, all,
      for the first minute, without so much as a straight look at him. He would
      have come to learn the reason of his friend&rsquo;s extraordinary public
      demonstration&mdash;having more right to his curiosity, or his anxiety or
      whatever, than any one else; he would be taking in the remarkable
      appearances that thus completed it, and would perhaps be showing quite a
      different face for them, at the point they had reached, than any that
      would have hitherto consorted with the beautiful security of his own
      position. So much, on our own young man&rsquo;s part, for this first flush of a
      presumption that he might have stirred the germs of ire in a celestial
      breast; so much for the moment during which nothing would have induced him
      to betray, to a possibly rueful member of an old aristocracy, a vulgar
      elation or a tickled, unaccustomed glee. His inevitable second thought
      was, however, it has to be confessed, another matter, which took a
      different turn&mdash;for, frankly, all the conscious conqueror in him, as
      Amy Evans would again have said, couldn&rsquo;t forego a probably supreme
      consecration. He treated himself to no prolonged reach of vision, but
      there was something he nevertheless fully measured for five seconds&mdash;the
      sharp truth of the fact, namely, of how the interested observer in the
      doorway must really have felt about him. Rather disconcertingly, hereupon,
      the sharp truth proved to be that the most amused, quite the most
      encouraging and the least invidious of smiles graced the young Lord&rsquo;s
      handsome countenance&mdash;forming, in short, his final contribution to a
      display of high social candour unprecedented in our hero&rsquo;s experience. No,
      he wasn&rsquo;t jealous, didn&rsquo;t do John Berridge the honour to be, to the extent
      of the least glimmer of a spark of it, but was so happy to see his
      immortal mistress do what she liked that he could positively beam at the
      odd circumstance of her almost lavishing public caresses on a gentleman
      not, after all, of negligible importance.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Well, it was all confounding enough, but this indication in particular
      would have jostled our friend&rsquo;s grasp of the presented cup had he had,
      during the next ten minutes, more independence of thought. That, however,
      was out of the question when one positively felt, as with a pang somewhere
      deep within, or even with a smothered cry for alarm, one&rsquo;s whole sense of
      proportion shattered at a blow and ceasing to serve. &ldquo;Not <i>straight</i>,
      and not too fast, shall we?&rdquo; was the ineffable young woman&rsquo;s appeal to
      him, a few minutes later, beneath the wide glass porch-cover that
      sheltered their brief wait for their chariot of fire. It was there even as
      she spoke; the capped charioteer, with a great clean curve, drew up at the
      steps of the porch, and the Princess&rsquo;s footman, before rejoining him in
      front, held open the door of the car. She got in, and Berridge was the
      next instant beside her; he could only say: &ldquo;As you like, Princess&mdash;where
      you will; certainly let us prolong it; let us prolong everything; don&rsquo;t
      let us have it over&mdash;strange and beautiful as it can only be!&mdash;a
      moment sooner than we must.&rdquo; So he spoke, in the security of their
      intimate English, while the perpendicular imperturbable <i>valet-de-pied</i>,
      white-faced in the electric light, closed them in and then took his place
      on the box where the rigid liveried backs of the two men, presented
      through the glass, were like a protecting wall; such a guarantee of
      privacy as might come&mdash;it occurred to Berridge&rsquo;s inexpugnable fancy&mdash;from
      a vision of tall guards erect round Eastern seraglios.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion had said something, by the time they started, about their
      taking a turn, their looking out for a few of the night-views of Paris
      that were so wonderful; and after that, in spite of his constantly prized
      sense of knowing his enchanted city and his way about, he ceased to follow
      or measure their course, content as he was with the particular exquisite
      assurance it gave him. <i>That</i> was knowing Paris, of a wondrous bland
      April night; that was hanging over it from vague consecrated lamp-studded
      heights and taking in, spread below and afar, the great scroll of all its
      irresistible story, pricked out, across river and bridge and radiant <i>place</i>,
      and along quays and boulevards and avenues, and around monumental circles
      and squares, in syllables of fire, and sketched and summarised, further
      and further, in the dim fire-dust of endless avenues; that was all of the
      essence of fond and thrilled and throbbing recognition, with a thousand
      things understood and a flood of response conveyed, a whole familiar
      possessive feeling appealed to and attested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From you, you know, it <i>would</i> be such a pleasure, and I think&mdash;in
      fact I&rsquo;m sure&mdash;it would do so much for the thing in America.&rdquo; Had she
      gone on as they went, or had there been pauses of easy and of charmed and
      of natural silence, breaks and drops from talk, but only into greater
      confidence and sweetness?&mdash;such as her very gesture now seemed a part
      of; her laying her gloved hand, for emphasis, on the back of his own,
      which rested on his knee and which took in from the act he scarce knew
      what melting assurance. The emphasis, it was true&mdash;this came to him
      even while for a minute he held his breath&mdash;seemed rather that of Amy
      Evans; and if her talk, while they rolled, had been in the sense of these
      words (he had really but felt that they were shut intimately in together,
      all his consciousness, all his discrimination of meanings and indications
      being so deeply and so exquisitely merged in that) the case wasn&rsquo;t as
      surely and sublimely, as extravagantly, as fabulously romantic for him as
      his excited pulses had been seeming to certify. Her hand was there on his
      own, in precious living proof, and splendid Paris hung over them, as a
      consecrating canopy, her purple night embroidered with gold; yet he
      waited, something stranger still having glimmered for him, waited though
      she left her hand, which expressed emphasis and homage and tenderness, and
      anything else she liked indeed&mdash;since it was all then a matter of
      what he next heard and what he slowly grew cold as he took from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know they do it here so charmingly&mdash;it&rsquo;s a compliment a clever
      man is always so glad to pay a literary friend, and sometimes, in the case
      of a great name like yours, it renders such a service to a poor little
      book like mine!&rdquo; She spoke ever so humbly and yet ever so gaily&mdash;and
      still more than before with this confidence of the sincere admirer and the
      comrade. That, yes, through his sudden sharpening chill, was what first
      became distinct for him; she was mentioning somehow her explanation and
      her conditions&mdash;her motive, in fine, disconcerting, deplorable,
      dreadful, in respect to the experience, otherwise so boundless, that he
      had taken her as having opened to him; and she was doing it, above all,
      with the clearest coolness of her general privilege. What in particular
      she was talking about he as yet, still holding his breath, wondered; it
      was something she wanted him to do for her&mdash;which was exactly what he
      had hoped, but something of what trivial and, heaven forgive them both, of
      what dismal order? Most of all, meanwhile, he felt the dire penetration of
      two or three of the words she had used; so that after a painful minute the
      quaver with which he repeated them resembled his-drawing, slowly,
      carefully, timidly, some barbed dart out of his flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A &lsquo;literary friend&rsquo;?&rdquo; he echoed as he turned his face more to her; so
      that, as they sat, the whites of her eyes, near to his own, gleamed in the
      dusk like some silver setting of deep sapphires.
    </p>
    <p>
      It made her smile&mdash;which in their relation now was like the breaking
      of a cool air-wave over the conscious sore flush that maintained itself
      through his general chill. &ldquo;Ah, of course you don&rsquo;t allow that I <i>am</i>
      literary&mdash;and of course if you&rsquo;re awfully cruel and critical and
      incorruptible you won&rsquo;t let it say for me what I so want it should!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we, where, in the name of all that&rsquo;s damnably, of all that&rsquo;s
      grotesquely delusive, are we?&rdquo; he said, without a sign, to himself; which
      was the form of his really being quite at sea as to what she was talking
      about. That uncertainty indeed he could but frankly betray by taking her
      up, as he cast about him, on the particular ambiguity that his voice
      perhaps already showed him to find most irritating. &ldquo;Let it show? &lsquo;It,&rsquo; 
      dear Princess&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my dear man, let your Preface show, the lovely, friendly,
      irresistible log-rolling Preface that I&rsquo;ve been asking you if you wouldn&rsquo;t
      be an angel and write for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took it in with a deep long gulp&mdash;he had never, it seemed to him,
      had to swallow anything so bitter. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been asking me if I wouldn&rsquo;t
      write you a Preface?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To &lsquo;The Velvet Glove&rsquo;&mdash;after I&rsquo;ve sent it to you and you&rsquo;ve judged
      if you really can. Of course I don&rsquo;t want you to perjure yourself; but&rdquo;&mdash;and
      she fairly brushed him again, at their close quarters, with her fresh
      fragrant smile&mdash;&ldquo;I do want you so to like me, and to say it all out
      beautifully and publicly.&rdquo; &ldquo;You want me to like you, Princess?&rdquo; &ldquo;But,
      heaven help us, haven&rsquo;t you understood?&rdquo; Nothing stranger could
      conceivably have been, it struck him&mdash;if he was right now&mdash;than
      this exquisite intimacy of her manner of setting him down on the other
      side of an abyss. It was as if she had lifted him first in her beautiful
      arms, had raised him up high, high, high, to do it, pressing him to her
      immortal young breast while he let himself go, and then, by some
      extraordinary effect of her native force and her alien quality, setting
      him down exactly where she wanted him to be&mdash;which was a thousand
      miles away from her. Once more, so preposterously face to face with her
      for these base issues, he took it all in; after which he felt his eyes
      close, for amazement, despair and shame, and his head, which he had some
      time before, baring his brow to the mild night, eased of its crush-hat,
      sink to confounded rest on the upholstered back of the seat. The act, the
      ceasing to see, and if possible to hear, was for the moment a retreat, an
      escape from a state that he felt himself fairly flatter by thinking of it
      as &ldquo;awkward&rdquo;; the state of really wishing that his humiliation might end,
      and of wondering in fact if the most decent course open to him mightn&rsquo;t be
      to ask her to stop the motor and let him down.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke no word for a long minute, or for considerably more than that;
      during which time the motor went and went, now even somewhat faster, and
      he knew, through his closed eyes, that the outer lights had begun to
      multiply and that they were getting back somewhere into the spacious and
      decorative quarters. He knew this, and also that his retreat, for all his
      attitude as of accommodating thought, his air&mdash;<i>that</i> presently
      and quickly came to him&mdash;of having perhaps gathered himself in, for
      an instant, at her behest, to turn over, in his high ingenuity, some
      humbugging &ldquo;rotten&rdquo; phrase or formula that he might place at her service
      and make the note of such an effort; he became aware, I say, that his
      lapse was but a half-retreat, with her strenuous presence and her earnest
      pressure and the close cool respiration of her good faith absolutely
      timing the moments of his stillness and the progress of the car. Yes, it
      was wondrous well, he had all but made the biggest of all fools of
      himself, almost as big a one as <i>she</i> was still, to every appearance,
      in her perfect serenity, trying to make of him; and the one straight
      answer to it <i>would</i> be that he should reach forward and touch the
      footman&rsquo;s shoulder and demand that the vehicle itself should make an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      That would be an answer, however, he continued intensely to see, only to
      inanely importunate, to utterly superfluous Amy Evans&mdash;not a bit to
      his at last exquisitely patient companion, who was clearly now quite
      taking it from him that what kept him in his attitude was the spring of
      the quick desire to oblige her, the charming loyal impulse to consider a
      little what he could do for her, say &ldquo;handsomely yet conscientiously&rdquo; (oh
      the loveliness!) before he should commit himself. She was enchanted&mdash;<i>that</i>
      seemed to breathe upon him; she waited, she hung there, she quite bent
      over him, as Diana over the sleeping Endymion, while all the conscientious
      man of letters in him, as she might so supremely have phrased it,
      struggled with the more peccable, the more muddled and &ldquo;squared,&rdquo; though,
      for her own ideal, the so much more <i>banal</i> comrade. Yes, he could
      keep it up now&mdash;that is he could hold out for his real reply, could
      meet the rather marked tension of the rest of their passage as well as
      she; he should be able somehow or other to make his wordless detachment,
      the tribute of his ostensibly deep consideration of her request, a retreat
      in good order. She <i>was</i>, for herself, to the last point of her
      guileless fatuity, Amy Evans and an asker for &ldquo;lifts,&rdquo; a conceiver of
      twaddle both in herself and in him; or at least, so far as she fell short
      of all this platitude, it was no fault of the really affecting folly of
      her attempt to become a mere magazine mortal after the only fashion she
      had made out, to the intensification of her self-complacency, that she
      might.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing might thus have touched him more&mdash;if to be touched, beyond a
      certain point, hadn&rsquo;t been to be squared&mdash;than the way she failed to
      divine the bearing of his thoughts; so that she had probably at no one
      small crisis of her life felt so much a promise in the flutter of her own
      as on the occasion of the beautiful act she indulged in at the very
      moment, he was afterward to recognise, of their sweeping into her great
      smooth, empty, costly street&mdash;a desert, at that hour, of lavish
      lamplight and sculptured stone. She raised to her lips the hand she had
      never yet released and kept it there a moment pressed close against them;
      he himself closing his eyes to the deepest detachment he was capable of
      while he took in with a smothered sound of pain that this was the
      conferred bounty by which Amy Evans sought most expressively to encourage,
      to sustain and to reward. The motor had slackened and in a moment would
      stop; and meanwhile even after lowering his hand again she hadn&rsquo;t let it
      go. This enabled it, while he after a further moment roused himself to a
      more confessed consciousness, to form with his friend&rsquo;s a more active
      relation, to possess him of hers, in turn, and with an intention the
      straighter that her glove had by this time somehow come off. Bending over
      it without hinderance, he returned as firmly and fully as the application
      of all his recovered wholeness of feeling, under his moustache, might
      express, the consecration the bareness of his own knuckles had received;
      only after which it was that, still thus drawing out his grasp of her, and
      having let down their front glass by his free hand, he signified to the
      footman his view of their stopping short.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had arrived; the high, closed <i>porte-cochere</i>, in its crested
      stretch of wall, awaited their approach; but his gesture took effect, the
      car pulled up at the edge of the pavement, the man, in an instant, was at
      the door and had opened it; quickly moving across the walk, the next
      moment, to press the bell at the gate. Berridge, as his hand now broke
      away, felt he had cut his cable; with which, after he had stepped out, he
      raised again the glass he had lowered and closed, its own being already
      down, the door that had released him. During these motions he had the
      sense of his companion, still radiant and splendid, but somehow
      momentarily suppressed, suspended, silvered over and celestially blurred,
      even as a summer moon by the loose veil of a cloud. So it was he saw her
      while he leaned for farewell on the open window-ledge; he took her in as
      her visible intensity of bright vagueness filled the circle that the
      interior of the car made for her. It was such a state as she would have
      been reduced to&mdash;he felt this, was certain of it&mdash;for the first
      time in her life; and it was he, poor John Berridge, after all, who would
      have created the condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Princess. I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vague was indeed no word for it&mdash;shine though she might, in her
      screened narrow niche, as with the liquefaction of her pearls, the glimmer
      of her tears, the freshness of her surprise. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t come in&mdash;when
      you&rsquo;ve had no supper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at her with a purpose of kindness that could never in his life
      have been greater; and at first but smiled without a word. He presently
      shook his head, however&mdash;doubtless also with as great a sadness. &ldquo;I
      seem to have supped to my fill, Princess. Thank you, I won&rsquo;t come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It drew from her, while she looked at him, a long low anxious wail. &ldquo;And
      you won&rsquo;t do my Preface?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Princess, I won&rsquo;t do your Preface. Nothing would induce me to say a
      word in print about you. I&rsquo;m in fact not sure I shall ever mention you in
      any manner at all as long as ever I live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had felt for an instant as if he were speaking to some miraculously
      humanised idol, all sacred, all jewelled, all votively hung about, but
      made mysterious, in the recess of its shrine, by the very thickness of the
      accumulated lustre. And &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t like me&mdash;?&rdquo; was the
      marvellous sound from the image.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Princess,&rdquo; was in response the sound of the worshipper, &ldquo;Princess, I
      adore you. But I&rsquo;m ashamed for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ashamed&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>are</i> Romance&mdash;as everything, and by what I make out every
      one, about you is; so what more do you want? Your Preface&mdash;the only
      one worth speaking of&mdash;was written long ages ago by the most
      beautiful imagination of man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Humanised at least for these moments, she could understand enough to
      declare that she didn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to understand. Don&rsquo;t attempt such base things. Leave those
      to us. Only live. Only be. <i>We&rsquo;ll</i> do the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved over&mdash;she had come close to the window. &ldquo;Ah, but Mr.
      Berridge&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised both hands; he shook them at her gently, in deep and soft
      deprecation. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sound my dreadful name. Fortunately, however, you
      can&rsquo;t help yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, <i>voyons!</i> I so want&mdash;&mdash;-!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He repeated his gesture, and when he brought down his hands they closed
      together on both of hers, which now quite convulsively grasped the
      window-ledge. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak, because when you speak you really say things&mdash;!&rdquo;
       &ldquo;You <i>are</i> Romance,&rdquo; he pronounced afresh and with the last intensity
      of conviction and persuasion. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all you have to do with it,&rdquo; he
      continued while his hands, for emphasis, pressed hard on her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their faces, in this way, were nearer together than ever, but with the
      effect of only adding to the vividness of that dire non-intelligence from
      which, all perversely and incalculably, her very beauty now appeared to
      gain relief. This made for him a pang and almost an anguish; the fear of
      her saying something yet again that would wretchedly prove how little he
      moved her perception. So his eyes, of remonstrant, of suppliant intention,
      met hers close, at the same time that these, so far from shrinking, but
      with their quite other swimming plea all bedimmed now, seemed almost to
      wash him with the tears of her failure. He soothed, he stroked, he
      reassured her hands, for tender conveyance of his meaning, quite as she
      had just before dealt with his own for brave demonstration of hers. It was
      during these instants as if the question had been which of them <i>could</i>
      most candidly and fraternally plead. Full but of that she kept it up. &ldquo;Ah,
      if you&rsquo;d only think, if you&rsquo;d only try&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He couldn&rsquo;t stand it&mdash;she was capable of believing he had edged away,
      excusing himself and trumping up a factitious theory, because he hadn&rsquo;t
      the wit, hadn&rsquo;t the hand, to knock off the few pleasant pages she asked
      him for and that any proper Frenchman, master of the <i>metier</i>, would
      so easily and gallantly have promised. Should she so begin to commit
      herself he&rsquo;d, by the immortal gods, anticipate it in the manner most
      admirably effective&mdash;in fact he&rsquo;d even thus make her further
      derogation impossible. Their faces were so close that he could practise
      any rich freedom&mdash;even though for an instant, while the back of the
      chauffeur guarded them on that side and his own presented breadth,
      amplified by his loose mantle, filled the whole window-space, leaving him
      no observation from any quarter to heed, he uttered, in a deep-drawn final
      groan, an irrepressible echo of his pang for what might have been, the
      muffled cry of his insistence. &ldquo;You <i>are</i> Romance!&rdquo;&mdash;he drove it
      intimately, inordinately home, his lips, for a long moment, sealing it,
      with the fullest force of authority, on her own; after which, as he broke
      away and the car, starting again, turned powerfully across the pavement,
      he had no further sound from her than if, all divinely indulgent but all
      humanly defeated, she had given the question up, falling back to infinite
      wonder. He too fell back, but could still wave his hat for her as she
      passed to disappearance in the great floridly framed aperture whose wings
      at once came together behind her.

    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      HE had been out but once since his arrival, Mark Monteith; that was the
      next day after&mdash;he had disembarked by night on the previous; then
      everything had come at once, as he would have said, everything had
      changed. He had got in on Tuesday; he had spent Wednesday for the most
      part down town, looking into the dismal subject of his anxiety&mdash;the
      anxiety that, under a sudden decision, had brought him across the
      unfriendly sea at mid-winter, and it was through information reaching him
      on Wednesday evening that he had measured his loss, measured above all his
      pain. These were two distinct things, he felt, and, though both bad, one
      much worse than the other. It wasn&rsquo;t till the next three days had pretty
      well ebbed, in fact, that he knew himself for so badly wounded. He had
      waked up on Thursday morning, so far as he had slept at all, with the
      sense, together, of a blinding New York blizzard and of a deep sore inward
      ache. The great white savage storm would have kept him at the best within
      doors, but his stricken state was by itself quite reason enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      He so felt the blow indeed, so gasped, before what had happened to him, at
      the ugliness, the bitterness, and, beyond these things, the sinister
      strangeness, that, the matter of his dismay little by little detaching and
      projecting itself, settling there face to face with him as something he
      must now live with always, he might have been in charge of some horrid
      alien thing, some violent, scared, unhappy creature whom there was small
      joy, of a truth, in remaining with, but whose behaviour wouldn&rsquo;t perhaps
      bring him under notice, nor otherwise compromise him, so long as he should
      stay to watch it. A young jibbering ape of one of the more formidable
      sorts, or an ominous infant panther, smuggled into the great gaudy hotel
      and whom it might yet be important he shouldn&rsquo;t advertise, couldn&rsquo;t have
      affected him as needing more domestic attention. The great gaudy hotel&mdash;The
      Pocahontas, but carried out largely on &ldquo;Du Barry&rdquo; lines&mdash;made all
      about him, beside, behind, below, above, in blocks and tiers and
      superpositions, a sufficient defensive hugeness; so that, between the
      massive labyrinth and the New York weather, life in a lighthouse during a
      gale would scarce have kept him more apart. Even when in the course of
      that worse Thursday it had occurred to him for vague relief that the
      odious certified facts couldn&rsquo;t be all his misery, and that, with his
      throat and a probable temperature, a brush of the epidemic, which was for
      ever brushing him, accounted for something, even then he couldn&rsquo;t resign
      himself to bed and broth and dimness, but only circled and prowled the
      more within his high cage, only watched the more from his tenth story the
      rage of the elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon he had a doctor&mdash;the caravanserai, which supplied
      everything in quantities, had one for each group of so many rooms&mdash;just
      in order to be assured that he was <i>grippé</i> enough for anything. What
      his visitor, making light of his attack, perversely told him was that he
      was, much rather, &ldquo;blue&rdquo; enough, and from causes doubtless known to
      himself&mdash;which didn&rsquo;t come to the same thing; but he &ldquo;gave him
      something,&rdquo; prescribed him warmth and quiet and broth and courage, and
      came back the next day as to readminister this last dose. He then
      pronounced him better, and on Saturday pronounced him well&mdash;all the
      more that the storm had abated and the snow had been dealt with as New
      York, at a push, knew how to deal with things. Oh, how New York knew how
      to deal&mdash;to deal, that is, with other accumulations lying passive to
      its hand&mdash;was exactly what Mark now ached with his impression of; so
      that, still threshing about in this consciousness, he had on the Saturday
      come near to breaking out as to what was the matter with him. The Doctor
      brought in somehow the air of the hotel&mdash;which, cheerfully and
      conscientiously, by his simple philosophy, the good man wished to diffuse;
      breathing forth all the echoes of other woes and worries and pointing the
      honest moral that, especially with such a thermometer, there were enough
      of these to go round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our sufferer, by that time, would have liked to tell some one; extracting,
      to the last acid strain of it, the full strength of his sorrow, taking it
      all in as he could only do by himself and with the conditions favourable
      at least to this, had been his natural first need. But now, he supposed,
      he <i>must</i> be better; there was something of his heart&rsquo;s heaviness he
      wanted so to give out. He had rummaged forth on the Thursday night half a
      dozen old photographs stuck into a leather frame, a small show-case that
      formed part of his usual equipage of travel&mdash;he mostly set it up on a
      table when he stayed anywhere long enough; and in one of the neat
      gilt-edged squares of this convenient portable array, as familiar as his
      shaving-glass or the hair-brushes, of backs and monograms now so
      beautifully toned and wasted, long ago given him by his mother, Phil
      Blood-good handsomely faced him. Not contemporaneous, and a little faded,
      but so saying what it said only the more dreadfully, the image seemed to
      sit there, at an immemorial window, like some long effective and only at
      last exposed &ldquo;decoy&rdquo; of fate. It was <i>because</i> he was so beautifully
      good-looking, because he was so charming and clever and frank&mdash;besides
      being one&rsquo;s third cousin, or whatever it was, one&rsquo;s early schoolfellow and
      one&rsquo;s later college classmate&mdash;that one had abjectly trusted him. To
      live thus with his unremoved, undestroyed, engaging, treacherous face, had
      been, as our traveller desired, to live with all of the felt pang; had
      been to consume it in such a single hot, sore mouthful as would so far as
      possible dispose of it and leave but cold dregs. Thus, if the Doctor,
      casting about for pleasantness, had happened to notice him there, salient
      since he was, and possibly by the same stroke even to know him, as New
      York&mdash;and more or less to its cost now, mightn&rsquo;t one say?&mdash;so
      abundantly and agreeable had, the cup would have overflowed and Monteith,
      for all he could be sure of the contrary, would have relieved himself
      positively in tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh <i>he&rsquo;s</i> what&rsquo;s the matter with me&mdash;that, looking after some
      of my poor dividends, as he for the ten years of my absence had served me
      by doing, he has simply jockeyed me out of the whole little collection,
      such as it was, and taken the opportunity of my return, inevitably at last
      bewildered and uneasy, to &lsquo;sail,&rsquo; ten days ago, for parts unknown and as
      yet unguessable. It isn&rsquo;t the beastly values themselves, however; that&rsquo;s
      only awkward and I can still live, though I don&rsquo;t quite know how I shall
      turn round; it&rsquo;s the horror of <i>his</i> having done it, and done it to
      <i>me</i>&mdash;without a mitigation or, so to speak, a warning or an
      excuse.&rdquo; That, at a hint or a jog, is what he would have brought out&mdash;only
      to feel afterward, no doubt, that he had wasted his impulse and profaned
      even a little his sincerity. The Doctor didn&rsquo;t in the event so much as
      glance at his cluster of portraits&mdash;which fact quite put before our
      friend the essentially more vivid range of imagery that a pair of eyes
      transferred from room to room and from one queer case to another, in such
      a place as that, would mainly be adjusted to. It wasn&rsquo;t for <i>him</i> to
      relieve himself touchingly, strikingly or whatever, to such a man: such a
      man might much more pertinently&mdash;save for professional discretion&mdash;have
      emptied out there his own bag of wonders; prodigies of observation,
      flowers of oddity, flowers of misery, flowers of the monstrous, gathered
      in current hotel practice. Countless possibilities, making doctors
      perfunctory, Mark felt, swarmed and seethed at their doors; it showed for
      an incalculable world, and at last, on Sunday, he decided to leave his
      room.

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Everything, as he passed through the place, went on&mdash;all the offices
      of life, the whole bustle of the market, and withal, surprisingly, scarce
      less that of the nursery and the playground; the whole sprawl in especial
      of the great gregarious fireside: it was a complete social scene in
      itself, on which types might figure and passions rage and plots thicken
      and dramas develop, without reference to any other sphere, or perhaps even
      to anything at all outside. The signs of this met him at every turn as he
      threaded the labyrinth, passing from one extraordinary masquerade of
      expensive objects, one portentous &ldquo;period&rdquo; of decoration, one violent
      phase of publicity, to another: the heavy heat, the luxuriance, the
      extravagance, the quantity, the colour, gave the impression of some
      wondrous tropical forest, where vociferous, bright-eyed, and feathered
      creatures, of every variety of size and hue, were half smothered between
      undergrowths of velvet and tapestry and ramifications of marble and
      bronze. The fauna and the flora startled him alike, and among them his
      bruised spirit drew in and folded its wings. But he roamed and rested,
      exploring and in a manner enjoying the vast rankness&mdash;in the depth of
      which he suddenly encountered Mrs. Folliott, whom he had last seen, six
      months before, in London, and who had spoken to him then, precisely, of
      Phil Bloodgood, for several years previous her confidential American agent
      and factotum too, as she might say, but at that time so little in her good
      books, for the extraordinary things he seemed to be doing, that she was
      just hurrying home, she had made no scruple of mentioning, to take
      everything out of his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark remembered how uneasy she had made him&mdash;how that very talk with
      her had wound him up to fear, as so acute and intent a little person she
      affected him; though he had affirmed with all emphasis and flourish his
      own confidence and defended, to iteration, his old friend. This passage
      had remained with him for a certain pleasant heat of intimacy, his
      partner, of the charming appearance, being what she was; he liked to think
      how they had fraternised over their difference and called each other
      idiots, or almost, without offence. It was always a link to have scuffled,
      failing a real scratch, with such a character; and he had at present the
      flutter of feeling that something of this would abide. <i>He</i> hadn&rsquo;t
      been hurrying home, at the London time, in any case; he was doing nothing
      then, and had continued to do it; he would want, before showing suspicion&mdash;that
      had been his attitude&mdash;to have more, after all, to go upon. Mrs.
      Folliott also, and with a great actual profession of it, remembered and
      rejoiced; and, also staying in the house as she was, sat with him, under a
      spreading palm, in a wondrous rococo salon, surrounded by the pinkest,
      that is the fleshiest, imitation Boucher panels, and wanted to know if he
      <i>now</i> stood up for his swindler. She would herself have tumbled on a
      cloud, very passably, in a fleshy Boucher manner, hadn&rsquo;t she been
      over-dressed for such an exercise; but she was quite realistically aware
      of what had so naturally happened&mdash;she was prompt about Bloodgood&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;flight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had acted with energy, on getting back&mdash;she had saved what she
      could; which hadn&rsquo;t, however, prevented her losing all disgustedly some
      ten thousand dollars. She was lovely, lively, friendly, interested, she
      connected Monteith perfectly with their discussion that day during the
      water-party on the Thames; but, sitting here with him half an hour, she
      talked only of her peculiar, her cruel sacrifice&mdash;since she should
      never get a penny back. He had felt himself, on their meeting, quite
      yearningly reach out to her&mdash;so decidedly, by the morning&rsquo;s end, and
      that of his scattered sombre stations, had he been sated with meaningless
      contacts, with the sense of people all about him intensely, though
      harmlessly, animated, yet at the same time raspingly indifferent. <i>They</i>
      would have, he and she at least, their common pang&mdash;through which
      fact, somehow, he should feel less stranded. It wasn&rsquo;t that he wanted to
      be pitied&mdash;he fairly didn&rsquo;t pity himself; he winced, rather, and even
      to vicarious anguish, as it rose again, for poor shamed Bloodgood&rsquo;s
      doom-ridden figure. But he wanted, as with a desperate charity, to give
      some easier turn to the mere ugliness of the main facts; to work off his
      obsession from them by mixing with it some other blame, some other pity,
      it scarce mattered what&mdash;if it might be some other experience; as an
      effect of which larger ventilation it would have, after a fashion and for
      a man of free sensibility, a diluted and less poisonous taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of five minutes of Mrs. Folliott, however, he felt his dry lips
      seal themselves to a makeshift simper. She could <i>take</i> nothing&mdash;no
      better, no broader perception of anything than fitted her own small
      faculty; so that though she must have recalled or imagined that he had
      still, up to lately, had interests at stake, the rapid result of her
      egotistical little chatter was to make him wish he might rather have
      conversed with the French waiter dangling in the long vista that showed
      the oriental café as a climax, or with the policeman, outside, the top of
      whose helmet peeped above the ledge of a window. She bewailed her wretched
      money to excess&mdash;she who, he was sure, had quantities more; she pawed
      and tossed her bare bone, with her little extraordinarily gemmed and
      manicured hands, till it acted on his nerves; she rang all the changes on
      the story, the dire fatality, of her having wavered and muddled, thought
      of this and but done that, of her stupid failure to have pounced, when she
      had first meant to, in season. She abused the author of their wrongs&mdash;recognising
      thus too Monteith&rsquo;s right to loathe him&mdash;for the desperado he
      assuredly had proved, but with a vulgarity of analysis and an incapacity
      for the higher criticism, as her listener felt it to be, which made him
      determine resentfully, almost grimly, that she shouldn&rsquo;t have the benefit
      of a grain of <i>his</i> vision or <i>his</i> version of what had befallen
      them, and of how, in particular, it had come; and should never dream
      thereby (though much would she suffer from that!) of how interesting he
      might have been. She had, in a finer sense, no manners, and to be
      concerned with her in any retrospect was&mdash;since their discourse was
      of losses&mdash;to feel the dignity of history incur the very gravest. It
      was true that such fantasies, or that any shade of inward irony, would be
      Greek to Mrs. Folliott. It was also true, however, and not much more
      strange, when she had presently the comparatively happy thought of &ldquo;Lunch
      with <i>us</i>, you poor dear!&rdquo; and mentioned three or four of her &ldquo;crowd&rdquo;&mdash;a
      new crowd, rather, for her, all great Sunday lunchers there and immense
      fun, who would in a moment be turning up&mdash;that this seemed to him as
      easy as anything else; so that after a little, deeper in the jungle and
      while, under the temperature as of high noon, with the crowd complete and
      &ldquo;ordering,&rdquo; he wiped the perspiration from his brow, he felt he was
      letting himself go. He did that certainly to the extent of leaving far
      behind any question of Mrs. Folliott&rsquo;s manners. They didn&rsquo;t matter there&mdash;nobody&rsquo;s
      did; and if she ceased to lament her ten thousand it was only because,
      among higher voices, she couldn&rsquo;t make herself heard. Poor Blood-good
      didn&rsquo;t have a show, as they might have said, didn&rsquo;t get through at any
      point; the crowd was so new that&mdash;there either having been no hue and
      cry for him, or having been too many others, for other absconders, in the
      intervals&mdash;they had never so much as heard of him and would have no
      more of Mrs. Folliott&rsquo;s true inwardness, on that subject at least, than
      she had lately cared to have of Monteith&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing like a crowd, this unfortunate knew, for making one feel
      lonely, and he felt so increasingly during the meal; but he got thus at
      least in a measure away from the terrible little lady; after which, and
      before the end of the hour, he wanted still more to get away from every
      one else. He was in fact about to perform this manoeuvre when he was
      checked by the jolly young woman he had been having on his left and who
      had more to say about the Hotels, up and down the town, than he had ever
      known a young woman to have to say on any subject at all; she expressed
      herself in hotel terms exclusively, the names of those establishments
      playing through her speech as the <i>leit-motif</i> might have recurrently
      flashed and romped through a piece of profane modern music. She wanted to
      present him to the pretty girl she had brought with her, and who had
      apparently signified to her that she must do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you know my brother-in-law, Mr. Newton Winch,&rdquo; the pretty girl
      had immediately said; she moved her head and shoulders together, as by a
      common spring, the effect of a stiff neck or of something loosened in her
      back hair; but becoming, queerly enough, all the prettier for doing so. He
      had seen in the papers, her brother-in-law, Mr. Monteith&rsquo;s arrival&mdash;Mr.
      Mark P. Monteith, wasn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;and where he was, and she had been with
      him, three days before, at the time; whereupon he had said &ldquo;Hullo, what
      can have brought old Mark back?&rdquo; He seemed to have believed&mdash;Newton
      had seemed&mdash;that that shirker, as he called him, never <i>would</i>
      come; and she guessed that if she had known she was going to meet such a
      former friend (&ldquo;Which he claims you are, sir,&rdquo; said the pretty girl) he
      would have asked her to find out what the trouble could be. But the real
      satisfaction would just be, she went on, if his former friend would
      himself go and see him and tell him; he had appeared of late so down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I remember him&rdquo;&mdash;Mark didn&rsquo;t repudiate the friendship, placing
      him easily; only then he wasn&rsquo;t married and the pretty girl&rsquo;s sister must
      have come in later: which showed, his not knowing such things, how they
      had lost touch. The pretty girl was sorry to have to say in return to this
      that her sister wasn&rsquo;t living&mdash;had died two years after marrying; so
      that Newton was up there in Fiftieth Street alone; where (in explanation
      of his being &ldquo;down&rdquo;) he had been shut up for days with bad <i>grippe</i>;
      though now on the mend, or she wouldn&rsquo;t have gone to him, not she, who had
      had it nineteen times and didn&rsquo;t want to have it again. But the horrid
      poison just seemed to have entered into poor Newton&rsquo;s soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way it <i>can</i> take you, don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; And then as, with
      her single twist, she just charmingly hunched her eyes at our friend,
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to go to see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mark bethought himself: &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to see a lady&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took the words from his mouth. &ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;re going to see a lady&mdash;every
      man in New York is. But Newton isn&rsquo;t a lady, unfortunately for him,
      to-day; and Sunday afternoon in this place, in this weather, alone&mdash;&mdash;-!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, isn&rsquo;t it awful?&rdquo;&mdash;he was quite drawn to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>you&rsquo;ve</i> got your lady!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve got my lady, thank goodness!&rdquo; The fervour of which was his
      sincere tribute to the note he had had on Friday morning from Mrs. Ash,
      the only thing that had a little tempered his gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, feel for others. Fit him in. Tell him why!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why I&rsquo;ve come back? I&rsquo;m glad I <i>have</i>&mdash;since it was to see <i>you</i>!&rdquo;
       Monteith made brave enough answer, promising to do what he could. He liked
      the pretty girl, with her straight attack and her free awkwardness&mdash;also
      with her difference from the others through something of a sense and a
      distinction given her by so clearly having Newton on her mind. Yet it was
      odd to him, and it showed the lapse of the years, that Winch&mdash;as he
      had known him of old&mdash;could <i>be</i> to that degree on any one&rsquo;s
      mind.

    <p>
      Outside in the intensity of the cold&mdash;it was a jump from the Tropics
      to the Pole&mdash;he felt afresh the force of what he had just been
      saying; that if it weren&rsquo;t for the fact of Mrs. Ash&rsquo;s good letter of
      welcome, despatched, characteristically, as soon as she had, like the
      faithful sufferer in Fiftieth Street, observed his name, in a newspaper,
      on one of the hotel-lists, he should verily, for want of a connection and
      an abutment, have scarce dared to face the void and the chill together,
      but have sneaked back into the jungle and there tried to lose himself. He
      made, as it was, the opposite effort, resolute to walk, though hovering
      now and then at vague crossways, radiations of roads to nothing, or taking
      cold counsel of the long but still sketchy vista, as it struck him, of the
      northward Avenue, bright and bleak, fresh and harsh, rich and evident
      somehow, a perspective like a page of florid modern platitudes. He didn&rsquo;t
      quite know what he had expected for his return&mdash;not certainly
      serenades and deputations; but without Mrs. Ash his mail would have quite
      lacked geniality, and it was as if Phil Blood-good had gone off not only
      with so large a slice of his small <i>peculium</i>, but with all the
      broken bits of the past, the loose ends of old relationships, that he had
      supposed he might pick up again. Well, perhaps he should still pick up a
      few&mdash;by the sweat of his brow; no motion of their own at least, he by
      this time judged, would send them fluttering into his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which reflections but quickened his forecast of this charm of the old
      Paris inveteracy renewed&mdash;the so-prized custom of nine years before,
      when he still believed in results from his fond frequentation of the Beaux
      Arts; that of walking over the river to the Rue de Marignan, precisely,
      every Sunday without exception, and sitting at her fireside, and often all
      offensively, no doubt, outstaying every one. How he had used to want those
      hours then, and how again, after a little, at present, the Rue de Marignan
      might have been before him! He had gone to her there at that time with his
      troubles, such as they were, and they had always worked for her amusement&mdash;which
      had been her happy, her clever way of taking them: she couldn&rsquo;t have done
      anything better for them in that phase, poor innocent things compared with
      what they might have been, than be amused by them. Perhaps that was what
      she would still be&mdash;with those of his present hour; now too they
      might inspire her with the touch she best applied and was most instinctive
      mistress of: this didn&rsquo;t at all events strike him as what he should most
      resent. It wasn&rsquo;t as if Mrs. Folliott, to make up for boring him with her
      own plaint, for example, had had so much as a gleam of conscious diversion
      over his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> delighted to see you, I&rsquo;ve such immensities to tell you!&rdquo;&mdash;it
      began with the highest animation twenty minutes later, the very moment he
      stood there, the sense of the Rue de Marignan in the charming room and in
      the things about all reconstituted, regrouped, wonderfully preserved, down
      to the very sitting-places in the same relations, and down to the faint
      sweet mustiness of generations of cigarettes; but everything else
      different, and even vaguely alien, and by a measure still other than that
      of their own stretched interval and of the dear delightful woman&rsquo;s just a
      little pathetic alteration of face. He had allowed for the nine years, and
      so, it was to be hoped, had she; but the last thing, otherwise, that would
      have been touched, he immediately felt, was the quality, the intensity, of
      her care to see him. She cared, oh so visibly and touchingly and almost
      radiantly&mdash;save for her being, yes, distinctly, a little <i>more</i>
      battered than from even a good nine years&rsquo; worth; nothing could in fact
      have perched with so crowning an impatience on the heap of what she had to
      &ldquo;tell&rdquo; as that special shade of revived consciousness of having him in
      particular to tell it to. It wasn&rsquo;t perhaps much to matter how soon she
      brought out and caused to ring, as it were, on the little recognised
      marqueterie table between them (such an anciently envied treasure), the
      heaviest gold-piece of current history she was to pay him with for having
      just so felicitously come back: he knew already, without the telling, that
      intimate domestic tension must lately, within those walls, have reached a
      climax and that he could serve supremely&mdash;oh how he was going to
      serve!&mdash;as the most sympathetic of all pairs of ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole thing was upon him, in any case, with the minimum of delay: Bob
      had had it from her, definitely, the first of the week, and it was
      absolutely final now, that they must set up avowedly separate lives&mdash;without
      horrible &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo; of any sort, but with her own situation, her
      independence, secured to her once for all. She had been coming to it,
      taking her time, and she had gone through&mdash;well, so old a friend
      would guess enough what; but she was at the point, oh blessedly now, where
      she meant to stay, he&rsquo;d see if she didn&rsquo;t; with which, in this wonderful
      way, he himself had arrived for the cream of it and she was just selfishly
      glad. Bob had gone to Washington&mdash;ostensibly on business, but really
      to recover breath; she had, speaking vulgarly, knocked the wind out of him
      and was allowing him time to turn round. Mrs. Folliott moreover, she was
      sure, would have gone&mdash;was certainly believed to have been seen there
      five days ago; and of course his first necessity, for public use, would be
      to patch up something with Mrs. Folliott. Mark knew about Mrs. Folliott?&mdash;who
      was only, for that matter, one of a regular &ldquo;bevy.&rdquo; Not that it signified,
      however, if he didn&rsquo;t: she would tell him about <i>her</i> later.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took occasion from the first fraction of a break not quite to know what
      he knew about Mrs. Folliott&mdash;though perhaps he could imagine a
      little; and it was probably at this minute that, having definitely settled
      to a position, and precisely in his very own tapestry <i>bergère</i>, the
      one with the delicious little spectral &ldquo;subjects&rdquo; on the back and seat, he
      partly exhaled, and yet managed partly to keep to himself, the deep
      resigned sigh of a general comprehension. He knew what he was &ldquo;in&rdquo; for, he
      heard her go on&mdash;she said it again and again, seemed constantly to be
      saying it while she smiled at him with her peculiar fine charm, her
      positive gaiety of sensibility, scarce dimmed: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just selfishly glad,
      just selfishly glad!&rdquo; Well, she was going to have reason to be; she was
      going to put the whole case to him, all her troubles and plans, and each
      act of the tragi-comedy of her recent existence, as to the dearest and
      safest sympathiser in all the world. There would be no chance for <i>his</i>
      case, though it was so much for his case he had come; yet there took place
      within him but a mild, dumb convulsion, the momentary strain of his
      substituting, by the turn of a hand, one prospect of interest for another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Squaring himself in his old <i>bergère</i>, and with his lips, during the
      effort, compressed to the same passive grimace that had an hour or two
      before operated for the encouragement of Mrs. Folliott&mdash;just as it
      was to clear the stage completely for the present more prolonged
      performance&mdash;he shut straight down, as he even in the act called it
      to himself, on any personal claim for social consideration and rendered a
      perfect little agony of justice to the grounds of his friend&rsquo;s vividness.
      For it was all the justice that could be expected of him that, though,
      secretly, he wasn&rsquo;t going to be interested in her being interesting, she
      was yet going to be so, all the same, by the very force of her lovely
      material (Bob Ash <i>was</i> such a pure pearl of a donkey!) and he was
      going to keep on knowing she was&mdash;yes, to the very end. When after
      the lapse of an hour he rose to go, the rich fact that she <i>had</i> been
      was there between them, and with an effect of the frankly, fearlessly,
      harmlessly intimate fireside passage for it that went beyond even the best
      memories of the pleasant past. He hadn&rsquo;t &ldquo;amused&rdquo; her, no, in quite the
      same way as in the Rue de Marignan time&mdash;it had then been he who for
      the most part took frequent turns, emphatic, explosive, elocutionary, over
      that wonderful waxed parquet while she laughed as for the young perversity
      of him from the depths of the second, the matching <i>bergère</i>. To-day
      she herself held and swept the floor, putting him merely to the trouble of
      his perpetual &ldquo;Brava!&rdquo; But that was all through the change of basis&mdash;the
      amusement, another name only for the thrilled absorption, having been
      inevitably for <i>him</i>; as how could it have failed to be with such a
      regular &ldquo;treat&rdquo; to his curiosity? With the tea-hour now other callers were
      turning up, and he got away on the plea of his wanting so to think it all
      over. He hoped again he hadn&rsquo;t too queer a grin with his assurance to her,
      as if she would quite know what he meant, that he had been thrilled to the
      core. But she returned, quite radiantly, that he had carried <i>her</i>
      completely away; and her sincerity was proved by the final frankness of
      their temporary parting. &ldquo;My pleasure of you is selfish, horribly, I
      admit; so that if <i>that</i> doesn&rsquo;t suit you&mdash;!&rdquo; Her faded beauty
      flushed again as she said it.

    <p>
      In the street again, as he resumed his walk, he saw how perfectly it would
      <i>have</i> to suit him and how he probably for a long time wouldn&rsquo;t be
      suited otherwise. Between them and that time, however, what mightn&rsquo;t, for
      him, poor devil, on his new basis, have happened? She wasn&rsquo;t at any rate
      within any calculable period going to care so much for anything as for the
      so quaintly droll terms in which her rearrangement with her husband&mdash;thanks
      to that gentleman&rsquo;s inimitable fatuity&mdash;would have to be made. This
      was what it was to own, exactly, her special grace&mdash;the brightest
      gaiety in the finest sensibility; <i>such</i> a display of which
      combination, Mark felt as he went (if he could but have done it still more
      justice) she must have regaled him with! That exquisite last flush of her
      fadedness could only remain with him; yet while he presently stopped at a
      street-corner in a district redeemed from desolation but by the passage
      just then of a choked trolley-car that howled, as he paused for it,
      beneath the weight of its human accretions, he seemed to know the inward
      &ldquo;sinking&rdquo; that had been determined in a hungry man by some extravagant
      sight of the preparation of somebody else&rsquo;s dinner. Florence Ash was
      dining, so to speak, off the feast of appreciation, appreciation of what
      she had to &ldquo;tell&rdquo; him, that he had left her seated at; and she was
      welcome, assuredly&mdash;welcome, welcome, welcome, he musingly, he
      wistfully, and yet at the same time a trifle mechanically, repeated,
      stayed as he was a moment longer by the suffering shriek of another public
      vehicle and a sudden odd automatic return of his mind to the pretty girl,
      the flower of Mrs. Folliott&rsquo;s crowd, who had spoken to him of Newton
      Winch. It was extraordinarily as if, on the instant, she reminded him,
      from across the town, that she had offered him dinner: it was really quite
      strangely, while he stood there, as if she had told him where he could go
      and get it. With which, none the less, it was apparently where he wouldn&rsquo;t
      find her&mdash;and what was there, after all, of nutritive in the image of
      Newton Winch? He made up his mind in a moment that it owed that property,
      which the pretty girl had somehow made imputable, to the fact of its
      simply being just then the one image of anything known to him that the
      terrible place had to offer. Nothing, he a minute later reflected, could
      have been so &ldquo;rum&rdquo; as that, sick and sore, of a bleak New York eventide,
      he should have had nowhere to turn if not to the said Fiftieth Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the direction he accordingly took, for when he found the number
      given him by the same remarkable agent of fate also present to his memory
      he recognised the direct intervention of Providence and how it absolutely
      required a miracle to explain his so precipitately embracing this loosest
      of connections. The miracle indeed soon grew clearer: Providence had, on
      some obscure system, chosen this very ridiculous hour to save him from
      cultivation of the sin of selfishness, the obsession of egotism, and was
      breaking him to its will by constantly directing his attention to the
      claims of others. Who could say what at that critical moment mightn&rsquo;t have
      become of Mrs. Folliott (otherwise too then so sadly embroiled!) if she
      hadn&rsquo;t been enabled to air to him her grievance and her rage?&mdash;just
      as who could deny that it must have done Florence Ash a world of good to
      have put her thoughts about Bob in order by the aid of a person to whom
      the vision of Bob in the light of those thoughts (or in other words to
      whom <i>her</i> vision of Bob and nothing else) would mean so delightfully
      much? It was on the same general lines that poor Newton Winch, bereft,
      alone, ill, perhaps dying, and with the drawback of a not very sympathetic
      personality&mdash;as Mark remembered it at least&mdash;to contend against
      in almost any conceivable appeal to human furtherance, it was on these
      lines, very much, that the luckless case in Fiftieth Street was offered
      him as a source of salutary discipline. The moment for such a lesson might
      strike him as strange, in view of the quite special and independent
      opportunity for exercise that his spirit had during the last three days
      enjoyed there in his hotel bedroom; but evidently his languor of charity
      needed some admonition finer than any it might trust to chance for, and by
      the time he at last, Winch&rsquo;s residence recognised, was duly elevated to
      his level and had pressed the electric button at his door, he felt himself
      acting indeed as under stimulus of a sharp poke in the side.

      Within the apartment to which he had been admitted, moreover, the fine
      intelligence we have imputed to him was in the course of three minutes
      confirmed; since it took him no longer than that to say to himself, facing
      his old acquaintance, that he had never seen any one so improved. The
      place, which had the semblance of a high studio light as well as a general
      air of other profusions and amplitudes, might have put him off a little by
      its several rather glaringly false accents, those of contemporary domestic
      &ldquo;art&rdquo; striking a little wild. The scene was smaller, but the rich confused
      complexion of the Pocahontas, showing through Du Barry paint and patches,
      might have set the example&mdash;which had been followed with the
      costliest candour&mdash;so that, clearly, Winch was in these days rich, as
      most people in New York seemed rich; as, in spite of Bob&rsquo;s depredations,
      Florence Ash was, as even Mrs. Folliott was in spite of Phil Bloodgood&rsquo;s,
      as even Phil Bloodgood himself must have been for reasons too obvious; as
      in fine every one had a secret for being, or for feeling, or for looking,
      every one at least but Mark Monteith.
    </p>
    <p>
      These facts were as nothing, however, in presence of his quick and strong
      impression that his pale, nervous, smiling, clean-shaven host had
      undergone since their last meeting some extraordinary process of
      refinement. He had been ill, unmistakably, and the effects of a plunge
      into plain clean living, where any fineness had remained, were often
      startling, sometimes almost charming. But independently of this, and for a
      much longer time, some principle of intelligence, some art of life, would
      discernibly have worked in him. Remembered from college years and from
      those two or three luckless and faithless ones of the Law School as
      constitutionally common, as consistently and thereby doubtless even rather
      powerfully coarse, clever only for uncouth and questionable things, he yet
      presented himself now as if he had suddenly and mysteriously been
      educated. There was a charm in his wide, &ldquo;drawn,&rdquo; convalescent smile, in
      the way his fine fingers&mdash;had he anything like fine fingers of old?&mdash;played,
      and just fidgeted, over the prompt and perhaps a trifle incoherent offer
      of cigars, cordials, ashtrays, over the question of his visitor&rsquo;s hat,
      stick, fur coat, general best accommodation and ease; and how the deuce,
      accordingly, had charm, for coming out so on top, Mark wondered, &ldquo;squared&rdquo;
       the other old elements? For the short interval so to have dealt with him
      what force had it turned on, what patented process, of the portentous New
      York order in which there were so many, had it skilfully applied? Were
      these the things New York did when you just gave her all her head, and
      that he himself then had perhaps too complacently missed? Strange almost
      to the point of putting him positively off at first&mdash;quite as an
      exhibition of the uncanny&mdash;this sense of Newton&rsquo;s having all the
      while neither missed nor muffed anything, and having, as with an eye to
      the <i>coup de théâtre</i> to come, lowered one&rsquo;s expectations, at the
      start, to that abject pitch. It might have been taken verily for an act of
      bad faith&mdash;really for such a rare stroke of subtlety as could scarce
      have been achieved by a straight or natural aim.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much as this at least came and went in Monteith&rsquo;s agitated mind; the
      oddest intensity of apprehension, admiration, mystification, which the
      high north-light of the March afternoon and the quite splendidly vulgar
      appeal of fifty overdone decorative effects somehow fostered and
      sharpened. Everything had already gone, however, the next moment, for
      wasn&rsquo;t the man he had come so much too intelligently himself to patronise
      absolutely bowling him over with the extraordinary speech: &ldquo;See here, you
      know&mdash;you must be ill, or have had a bad shock, or some beastly
      upset: are you very sure you ought to have come out?&rdquo; Yes, he after an
      instant believed his ears; coarse common Newton Winch, whom he had called
      on because he could, as a gentleman, after all afford to, coarse common
      Newton Winch, who had had troubles and been epidemically poisoned,
      lamentably sick, who bore in his face and in the very tension, quite
      exactly the &ldquo;charm,&rdquo; of his manner, the traces of his late ordeal, and,
      for that matter, of scarce completed gallant emergence&mdash;this
      astonishing ex-comrade was simply writing himself at a stroke (into our
      friend&rsquo;s excited imagination at all events) the most distinguished of men.
      Oh, <i>he</i> was going to be interesting, if Florence Ash had been going
      to be; but Mark felt how, under the law of a lively present difference,
      that would be as an effect of one&rsquo;s having one&rsquo;s self thoroughly rallied.
      He knew within the minute that the tears stood in his eyes; he stared
      through them at his friend with a sharp &ldquo;Why, how do you know? How <i>can</i>
      you?&rdquo; To which he added before Winch could speak: &ldquo;I met your charming
      sister-in-law a couple of hours since&mdash;at luncheon, at the
      Pocahontas; and heard from her that you were badly laid up and had spoken
      of me. So I came to minister to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The object of this design hovered there again, considerably restless,
      shifting from foot to foot, changing his place, beginning and giving up
      motions, striking matches for a fresh cigarette, offering them again,
      redundantly, to his guest and then not lighting himself&mdash;but all the
      while with the smile of another creature than the creature known to Mark;
      all the while with the history of something that had happened to him ever
      so handsomely shining out. Mark was conscious within himself from this
      time on of two quite distinct processes of notation&mdash;that of his
      practically instant surrender to the consequences of the act of perception
      in his host of which the two women trained suppos-ably in the art of
      pleasing had been altogether incapable; and that of some other condition
      on Newton&rsquo;s part that left his own poor power of divination nothing less
      than shamed. This last was signally the case on the former&rsquo;s saying, ever
      so responsively, almost radiantly, in answer to his account of how he
      happened to come: &ldquo;Oh then it&rsquo;s very interesting!&rdquo; <i>That</i> was the
      astonishing note, after what he had been through: neither Mrs. Folliott
      nor Florence Ash had so much as hinted or breathed to him that <i>he</i>
      might have incurred that praise. No wonder therefore he was now taken&mdash;with
      this fresh party&rsquo;s instant suspicion and imputation of it; though it was
      indeed for some minutes next as if each tried to see which could accuse
      the other of the greater miracle of penetration. Mark was so struck, in a
      word, with the extraordinarily straight guess Winch had had there in
      reserve for him that, other quick impressions helping, there was nothing
      for him but to bring out, himself: &ldquo;There must be, my dear man, something
      rather wonderful the matter with you!&rdquo; The quite more intensely and more
      irresistibly drawn grin, the quite unmistakably deeper consciousness in
      the dark, wide eye, that accompanied the not quite immediate answer to
      which remark he was afterward to remember. &ldquo;How do you know that&mdash;or
      why do you think it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because there <i>must</i> be&mdash;for you to see!
      I shouldn&rsquo;t have expected it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you take me for a damned fool?&rdquo; laughed wonderful Newton Winch.

    </h2>
    <p>
      He could say nothing that, whether as to the sense of it or as to the way
      of it, didn&rsquo;t so enrich Mark&rsquo;s vision of him that our friend, after a
      little, as this effect proceeded, caught himself in the act of almost too
      curiously gaping. Everything, from moment to moment, fed his curiosity;
      such a question, for instance, as whether the quite ordinary peepers of
      the Newton Winch of their earlier youth could have looked, under any
      provocation, either dark or wide; such a question, above all, as how <i>this</i>
      incalculable apparition came by the whole startling power of play of its
      extravagantly sensitive labial connections&mdash;exposed, so to its
      advantage (he now jumped at one explanation) by the removal of what had
      probably been one of the vulgar-est of moustaches. With this, at the same
      time, the oddity of that particular consequence was vivid to him; the
      glare of his curiosity fairly lasting while he remembered how he had once
      noted the very opposite turn of the experiment for Phil Bloodgood. He
      would have said in advance that poor Winch couldn&rsquo;t have afforded to risk
      showing his &ldquo;real&rdquo; mouth; just as he would have said that in spite of the
      fine ornament that so considerably muffled it Phil could only have gained
      by showing his. But to have seen Phil shorn&mdash;as he once had done&mdash;was
      earnestly to pray that he might promptly again bristle; beneath Phil&rsquo;s
      moustache lurked nothing to &ldquo;make up&rdquo; for it in case of removal. While he
      thought of which things the line of grimace, as he could only have called
      it, the mobile, interesting, ironic line the great double curve of which
      connected, in the face before him, the strong nostril with the lower
      cheek, became the very key to his first idea of Newton&rsquo;s capture of
      refinement. He had shaved and was happily transfigured. Phil Bloodgood had
      shaved and been wellnigh lost; though why should he just now too
      precipitately drag the reminiscence in?
    </p>
    <p>
      That question too, at the queer touch of association, played up for Mark
      even under so much proof that the state of his own soul was being with the
      lapse of every instant registered. Phil Bloodgood had brought about the
      state of his soul&mdash;there was accordingly that amount of connection;
      only it became further remarkable that from the moment his companion had
      sounded him, and sounded him, he knew, down to the last truth of things,
      his disposition, his necessity to talk, the desire that had in the morning
      broken the spell of his confinement, the impulse that had thrown him so
      defeatedly into Mrs. Folliott&rsquo;s arms and into Florence Ash&rsquo;s, these forces
      seemed to feel their impatience ebb and their discretion suddenly grow.
      His companion was talking again, but just then, incongruously, made his
      need to communicate lose itself. It was as if his personal case had
      already been touched by some tender hand&mdash;and that, after all, was
      the modest limit of its greed. &ldquo;I know now why you came back&mdash;did
      Lottie mention how I had wondered? But sit down, sit down&mdash;only let
      me, nervous beast as I am, take it standing!&mdash;and believe me when I
      tell you that I&rsquo;ve now ceased to wonder. My dear chap, I <i>have</i> it!
      It can&rsquo;t but have been for poor Phil Blood-good. He sticks out of you, the
      brute&mdash;as how, with what he has done to you, shouldn&rsquo;t he? There was
      a man to see me yesterday&mdash;Tim Slater, whom I don&rsquo;t think you know,
      but who&rsquo;s &lsquo;on&rsquo; everything within about two minutes of its happening (I
      never saw such a fellow!) and who confirmed my supposition, all my own,
      however, mind you, at first, that you&rsquo;re one of the sufferers. So how the
      devil can you <i>not</i> feel knocked? Why <i>should</i> you look as if
      you were having the time of your life? What a hog to have played it on <i>you</i>,
      on <i>you</i>, of all his friends!&rdquo; So Newton Winch continued, and so the
      air between the two men might have been, for a momentary watcher&mdash;which
      is indeed what I can but invite the reader to become&mdash;that of a
      nervously displayed, but all considerate, as well as most acute, curiosity
      on the one side, and that on the other, after a little, of an eventually
      fascinated acceptance of so much free and in especial of so much right
      attention. &ldquo;Do you <i>mind</i> my asking you? Because if you do I won&rsquo;t
      press; but as a man whose own responsibilities, some of &lsquo;em at least,
      don&rsquo;t differ much, I gather, from some of his, one would like to know how
      he was ever allowed to get to the point&mdash;! But I <i>do</i> plough you
      up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mark sat back in his chair, moved but holding himself, his elbows squared
      on each arm, his hands a bit convulsively interlocked across him&mdash;very
      much in fact as he had appeared an hour ago in the old tapestry <i>bergère</i>;
      but as his rigour was all then that of the grinding effort to profess and
      to give, so it was considerably now for the fear of too hysterically
      gushing. Somehow too&mdash;since his wound was to that extent open&mdash;he
      winced at hearing the author of it branded. He hadn&rsquo;t so much minded the
      epithets Mrs. Folliott had applied, for they were to the appropriator of
      <i>her</i> securities. As the appropriator of his own he didn&rsquo;t so much
      want to brand him as&mdash;just more &ldquo;amusingly&rdquo; even, if one would.&mdash;to
      make out, perhaps, with intelligent help, how such a man, in such a
      relation, <i>could</i> come to tread such a path: which was exactly the
      interesting light that Winch&rsquo;s curiosity and sympathy were there to assist
      him to. He pleaded at any rate immediately his advertising no grievance.
      &ldquo;I feel sore, I admit, and it&rsquo;s a horrid sort of thing to have had happen;
      but when you call him a brute and a hog I rather squirm, for brutes and
      hogs never live, I guess, in the sort of hell in which he now must be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newton Winch, before the fireplace, his hands deep in his pockets, where
      his guest could see his long fingers beat a tattoo on his thighs, Newton
      Winch dangled and swung himself, and threw back his head and laughed.
      &ldquo;Well, I must say you take it amazingly!&mdash;all the more that to see
      you again this way is to feel that if, all along, there was a man whose
      delicacy and confidence and general attitude might have marked him for a
      particular consideration, you&rsquo;d have been the man.&rdquo; And they were more
      directly face to face again; with Newton smiling and smiling <i>so</i>
      appreciatively; making our friend in fact almost ask himself when before a
      man had ever grinned from ear to ear to the effect of its so becoming him.
      What he replied, however, was that Newton described in those flattering
      terms a client temptingly fatuous; after which, and the exchange of
      another protest or two in the interest of justice and decency, and another
      plea or two in that of the still finer contention that even the basest
      misdeeds had always somewhere or other, could one get at it, their
      propitiatory side, our hero found himself on his feet again, under the
      influence of a sudden failure of everything but horror&mdash;a horror
      determined by some turn of their talk and indeed by the very fact of the
      freedom of it. It was as if a far-borne sound of the hue and cry, a vision
      of his old friend hunted and at bay, had suddenly broken in&mdash;this
      other friend&rsquo;s, this irresistibly intelligent other companion&rsquo;s,
      practically vivid projection of that making the worst ugliness real. &ldquo;Oh,
      it&rsquo;s just making my wry face to somebody, and your letting me and caring
      and wanting to know: that,&rdquo; Mark said, &ldquo;is what does me good; not any
      other hideous question. I mean I don&rsquo;t take any interest in <i>my</i> case&mdash;what
      one wonders about, you see, is what can be done for him. I mean, that is&rdquo;&mdash;for
      he floundered a little, not knowing at last quite what he did mean, a
      great rush of mere memories, a great humming sound as of thick, thick
      echoes, rising now to an assault that he met with his face indeed
      contorted. If he didn&rsquo;t take care he should howl; so he more or less
      successfully took care&mdash;yet with his host vividly watching him while
      he shook the danger temporarily off. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind&mdash;though it&rsquo;s
      rather <i>that</i>; my having felt this morning, after three dismal dumb
      bad days, that one&rsquo;s friends perhaps would be thinking of one. All I&rsquo;m
      conscious of now&mdash;I give you my word&mdash;is that I&rsquo;d like to see
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d like to see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; Mark ruefully smiled, &ldquo;that I should like him to see <i>me</i>&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newton Winch, from where he stood&mdash;and they were together now, on the
      great hearth-rug that was a triumph of modern orientalism&mdash;put out
      one of the noted fine hands and, with an expressive headshake, laid it on
      his shoulder. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wish him that, Monteith&mdash;don&rsquo;t wish him that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but,&rdquo;&mdash;and Mark raised his eyebrows still higher&mdash;&ldquo;he&rsquo;d
      see I bear up; pretty well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid he should see, my dear fellow!&rdquo; Newton cried as for the pang
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark had for his idea, at any rate, the oddest sense of an exaltation that
      grew by this use of frankness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d go to him. Hanged if I wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;anywhere!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His companion&rsquo;s hand still rested on him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d go to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mark stood up to it&mdash;though trying to sink solemnity as pretentious.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d go like a shot.&rdquo; And then he added: &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s probably what&mdash;when
      we&rsquo;ve turned round&mdash;I <i>shall</i> do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When &lsquo;we&rsquo; have turned round?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;he was a trifle disconcerted at the tone&mdash;&ldquo;I say that
      because you&rsquo;ll have helped me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I do nothing but want to help you!&rdquo; Winch replied&mdash;which made it
      right again; especially as our friend still felt himself reassuringly and
      sustainingly grasped. But Winch went on: &ldquo;You <i>would</i> go to him&mdash;in
      kindness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;to understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To understand how he could swindle you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Mark kept on, &ldquo;to try and make out with him how, after such things&mdash;!&rdquo;
       But he stopped; he couldn&rsquo;t name them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as if his companion knew. &ldquo;Such things as you&rsquo;ve done for him of
      course&mdash;such services as you&rsquo;ve rendered him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, from far back. If I could tell you,&rdquo; our friend vainly wailed&mdash;&ldquo;if
      I could tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Newton Winch patted his shoulder. &ldquo;Tell me&mdash;tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sort of relation, I mean; ever so many things of a kind&mdash;!&rdquo;
       Again, however, he pulled up; he felt the tremor of his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, tell me,&rdquo; Winch repeated with the same movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone in it now made their eyes meet again, and with this presentation
      of the altered face Mark measured as not before, for some reason, the
      extent of the recent ravage. &ldquo;You must have been ill indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty bad. But I&rsquo;m better. And you do me good&rdquo;&mdash;with which the
      light of convalescence came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t awfully bore you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winch shook his head. &ldquo;You keep me up&mdash;and you see how no one else
      comes near me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mark&rsquo;s eyes made out that he was better&mdash;though it wasn&rsquo;t yet that
      nothing was the matter with him. If there was ever a man with whom there
      was still something the matter&mdash;! Yet one couldn&rsquo;t insist on that,
      and meanwhile he clearly did want company. &ldquo;Then there we are. I myself
      had no one to go to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You save my life,&rdquo; Newton renewedly grinned.

    <h2>
      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s your own fault,&rdquo; Mark replied to that, &ldquo;if you make me take
      advantage of you.&rdquo; Winch had withdrawn his hand, which was back, violently
      shaking keys or money, in his trousers pocket; and in this position he had
      abruptly a pause, a sensible, absence, that might have represented either
      some odd drop of attention, some turn-off to another thought, or just
      simply the sudden act of listening. His guest had indeed himself&mdash;under
      suggestion&mdash;the impression of a sound. &ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t you perhaps&mdash;if
      you hear something&mdash;have a call?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mark had said it so lightly, however, that he was the more struck with his
      host&rsquo;s appearing to turn just paler; and, with it, the latter now <i>was</i>
      listening. &ldquo;You hear something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought <i>you</i> did.&rdquo; Winch himself, on Mark&rsquo;s own pressure of the
      outside bell, had opened the door of the apartment&mdash;an indication
      then, it sufficiently appeared, that Sunday afternoons were servants&rsquo;, or
      attendants&rsquo;, or even trained nurses&rsquo; holidays. It had also marked the
      stage of his convalescence, and to that extent&mdash;after his first flush
      of surprise&mdash;had but smoothed Monteith&rsquo;s way. At present he barely
      gave further attention; detaching himself as under some odd cross-impulse,
      he had quitted the spot and then taken, in the wide room, a restless turn&mdash;only,
      however, to revert in a moment to his friend&rsquo;s just-uttered deprecation of
      the danger of boring him. &ldquo;If I make you take advantage of me&mdash;that
      is blessedly talk to me&mdash;it&rsquo;s exactly what I want to do. Talk to me&mdash;talk
      to me!&rdquo; He positively waved it on; pulling up again, however, in his own
      talk, to say with a certain urgency: &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mark, who stayed before the fire, couldn&rsquo;t but excuse himself. &ldquo;Thanks&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      very well so. I think of things and I fidget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winch stood a moment with his eyes on the ground. &ldquo;Are you very sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite&mdash;I&rsquo;m all right if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then as you like!&rdquo; With which, shaking to extravagance again his long
      legs, Newton had swung off&mdash;only with a movement that, now his back
      was turned, affected his visitor as the most whimsical of all the forms of
      his rather unnatural manner. He was curiously different with his back
      turned, as Mark now for the first time saw it&mdash;dangling and somewhat
      wavering, as from an excess of uncertainty of gait; and this impression
      was so strange, it created in our friend, uneasily and on the spot, such a
      need of explanation, that his speech was stayed long enough to give Winch
      time to turn round again. The latter had indeed by this moment reached one
      of the limits of the place, the wide studio bay, where he paused, his back
      to the light and his face afresh presented, to let his just passingly
      depressed and quickened eyes take in as much as possible of the large
      floor, range over it with such brief freedom of search as the disposition
      of the furniture permitted. He was looking for something, though the
      betrayed reach of vision was but of an instant. Mark caught it, however,
      and with his own sensibility all in vibration, found himself feeling at
      once that it meant something and that what it meant was connected with his
      entertainer&rsquo;s slightly marked appeal to him, the appeal of a moment
      before, not to remain standing. Winch knew by this time quite easily
      enough that he was hanging fire; which meant that they were suddenly
      facing each other across the wide space with a new consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything had changed&mdash;changed extraordinarily with the mere turning
      of that gentleman&rsquo;s back, the treacherous aspect of which its owner
      couldn&rsquo;t surely have suspected. If the question was of the pitch of their
      sensibility, at all events, it wouldn&rsquo;t be Mark&rsquo;s that should vibrate to
      least purpose. Visibly it had come to his host that something had within
      the few instants remarkably happened, but there glimmered on him an
      induction that still made him keep his own manner. Newton himself might
      now resort to any manner he liked. His eyes had raked the floor to recover
      the position of something dropped or misplaced, and something, above all,
      awkward or compromising; and he had wanted his companion not to command
      this scene from the hearth-rug, the hearthrug where he had been just
      before holding him, hypnotising him to blindness, <i>because</i> the
      object in question would there be most exposed to sight Mark embraced this
      with a further drop&mdash;while the apprehension penetrated&mdash;of his
      power to go on, and with an immense desire at the same time that his eyes
      should seem only to look at his friend; who broke out now, for that
      matter, with a fresh appeal. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to take advantage of me,
      man&mdash;aren&rsquo;t you going to <i>take</i> it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everything had changed, we have noted, and nothing could more have proved
      it than the fact that, by the same turn, sincerity of desire had dropped
      out of Winch&rsquo;s chords, while irritation, sharp and almost imperious, had
      come in. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because he sees I see something!&rdquo; Mark said to himself;
      but he had no need to add that it shouldn&rsquo;t prevent his seeing more&mdash;for
      the simple reason that, in a miraculous fashion, this was exactly what he
      did do in glaring out the harder. It was beyond explanation, but the very
      act of blinking thus in an attempt at showy steadiness became one and the
      same thing with an optical excursion lasting the millionth of a minute and
      making him aware that the edge of a rug, at the point where an arm-chair,
      pushed a little out of position, over-straddled it, happened just not
      wholly to have covered in something small and queer, neat and bright,
      crooked and compact, in spite of the strong toe-tip surreptitiously
      applied to giving it the right lift Our gentleman, from where he hovered,
      and while looking straight at the master of the scene, yet saw, as by the
      tiny flash of a reflection from fine metal, <i>under</i> the chair. What
      he recognised, or at least guessed at, as sinister, made him for a moment
      turn cold, and that chill was on him while Winch again addressed him&mdash;as
      differently as possible from any manner yet used. &ldquo;I beg of you in God&rsquo;s
      name to talk to me&mdash;to <i>talk</i> to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It had the ring of pure alarm and anguish, but was by this turn at least
      more human than the dazzling glitter of intelligence to which the poor man
      had up to now been treating him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, my good friend, who are in
      deep trouble,&rdquo; Mark was accordingly quick to reply, &ldquo;and I ask your pardon
      for being so taken up with my own sorry business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m in deep trouble&rdquo;&mdash;with which Winch came nearer again;
      &ldquo;but turning you on was exactly what I wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mark Monteith, at this, couldn&rsquo;t, for all his rising dismay, but laugh
      out; his sense of the ridiculous so swallowed up, for that brief
      convulsion, his sense of the sinister. Of such conivence in pain, it
      seemed, was the fact of another&rsquo;s pain, and of so much worth again
      disinterested sympathy! &ldquo;Your interest was then&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My interest was in your being interesting. For you <i>are!</i> And my
      nerves&mdash;!&rdquo; said Newton Winch with a face from which the mystifying
      smile had vanished, yet in which distinction, as Mark so persistently
      appreciated it, still sat in the midst of ravage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark wondered and wondered&mdash;he made strange things out. &ldquo;Your nerves
      have needed company.&rdquo; He could lay his hand on him now, even as shortly
      before he had felt Winch&rsquo;s own pressure of possession and detention. &ldquo;As
      good for you yourself, that&mdash;or still better,&rdquo; he went on&mdash;&ldquo;than
      I and my grievance were to have found you. Talk to we, talk to we, Newton
      Winch!&rdquo; he added with an immense inspiration of charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a different matter&mdash;that others but too much can do! But I&rsquo;ll
      say this. If you want to go to Phil Bloodgood&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Mark as he stopped. He stopped, and Mark had now a hand on
      each of his shoulders and held him at arm&rsquo;s-length, held him with a fine
      idea that was not disconnected from the sight of the small neat weapon he
      had been fingering in the low luxurious morocco chair&mdash;it was of the
      finest orange colour&mdash;and then had laid beside him on the carpet;
      where, after he had admitted his visitor, his presence of mind coming back
      to it and suggesting that he couldn&rsquo;t pick it up without making it more
      conspicuous, he had thought, by some swing of the foot or other casual
      manoeuvre, to dissimulate its visibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were at close quarters now as not before and Winch perfectly passive,
      with eyes that somehow had no shadow of a secret left and with the
      betrayal to the sentient hands that grasped him of an intense, an
      extraordinary general tremor. To Mark&rsquo;s challenge he opposed afresh a
      brief silence, but the very quality of it, with his face speaking, was
      that of a gaping wound. &ldquo;Well, you needn&rsquo;t take <i>that</i> trouble. You
      see I&rsquo;m such another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such another as Phil&mdash;&mdash;-?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He didn&rsquo;t blink. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know for sure, but I guess I&rsquo;m worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean you&rsquo;re guilty&mdash;&mdash;-?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean I shall be wanted. Only I&rsquo;ve stayed to take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mark threw back his head, but only tightened his hands. He inexpressibly
      understood, and nothing in life had ever been so strange and dreadful to
      him as his thus helping himself by a longer and straighter stretch, as it
      were, to the monstrous sense of his friend&rsquo;s &ldquo;education.&rdquo; It had been, in
      its immeasurable action, the education of business, of which the fruits
      were all around them. Yet prodigious was the interest, for prodigious
      truly&mdash;it seemed to loom before Mark&mdash;must have been the system.
      &ldquo;To &lsquo;take&rsquo; it?&rdquo; he echoed; and then, though faltering a little, &ldquo;To take
      what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had scarce spoken when a long sharp sound shrilled in from the outer
      door, seeming of so high and peremptory a pitch that with the start it
      gave him his grasp of his host&rsquo;s shoulders relaxed an instant, though to
      the effect of no movement in <i>them</i> but what came from just a
      sensibly intenser vibration of the whole man. &ldquo;For <i>that</i>!&rdquo; said
      Newton Winch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve known&mdash;&mdash;-?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve expected. You&rsquo;ve helped me to wait.&rdquo; And then as Mark gave an ironic
      wail: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve tided me over. My condition has <i>wanted</i> somebody or
      something. Therefore, to complete this service, will you be so good as to
      open the door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Deep in the eyes Mark looked him, and still to the detection of no glimmer
      of the earlier man in the depths. The earlier man had been what he
      invidiously remembered&mdash;yet would <i>he</i> had been the whole
      simpler story! Then he moved his own eyes straight to the chair under
      which the revolver lay and which was but a couple of yards away. He felt
      his companion take this consciousness in, and it determined in them
      another long, mute exchange. &ldquo;What do you mean to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On your honour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>My</i> &lsquo;honour&rsquo;?&rdquo; his host returned with an accent that he felt even
      as it sounded he should never forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      It brought to his own face a crimson flush&mdash;he dropped his guarding
      hands. Then as for a last look at him: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wonderful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We <i>are</i> wonderful,&rdquo; said Newton Winch, while, simultaneously with
      the words, the pressed electric bell again and for a longer time pierced
      the warm cigaretted air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark turned, threw up his arms, and it was only when he had passed through
      the vestibule and laid his hand on the door-knob that the horrible noise
      dropped. The next moment he was face to face with two visitors, a
      nondescript personage in a high hat and an astrakhan collar and cuffs, and
      a great belted constable, a splendid massive New York &ldquo;officer&rdquo; of the
      type he had had occasion to wonder at much again in the course of his
      walk, the type so by itself&mdash;his wide observation quite suggested&mdash;among
      those of the peacemakers of the earth. The pair stepped straight in&mdash;no
      word was said; but as he closed the door behind them Mark heard the
      infallible crack of a discharged pistol and, so nearly with it as to make
      all one violence, the sound of a great fall; things the effect of which
      was to lift him, as it were, with his company, across the threshold of the
      room in a shorter time than that taken by this record of the fact. But
      their rush availed little; Newton was stretched on his back before the
      fire; he had held the weapon horribly to his temple, and his upturned face
      was disfigured. The emissaries of the law, looking down at him, exhaled
      simultaneously a gruff imprecation, and then while the worthy in the high
      hat bent over the subject of their visit the one in the helmet raised a
      severe pair of eyes to Mark. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, sir, you might have
      prevented it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mark took a hundred things in, it seemed to him&mdash;things of the scene,
      of the moment, and of all the strange moments before; but one appearance
      more vividly even than the others stared out at him. &ldquo;I really think I
      must practically have caused it.&rdquo;

      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      THREE times within a quarter of an hour&mdash;shifting the while his
      posture on his chair of contemplation&mdash;had he looked at his watch as
      for its final sharp hint that he should decide, that he should get up. His
      seat was one of a group fairly sequestered, unoccupied save for his own
      presence, and from where he lingered he looked off at a stretch of lawn
      freshened by recent April showers and on which sundry small children were
      at play. The trees, the shrubs, the plants, every stem and twig just
      ruffled as by the first touch of the light finger of the relenting year,
      struck him as standing still in the blest hope of more of the same caress;
      the quarter about him held its breath after the fashion of the child who
      waits with the rigour of an open mouth and shut eyes for the promised
      sensible effect of his having been good. So, in the windless, sun-warmed
      air of the beautiful afternoon, the Park of the winter&rsquo;s end had struck
      White-Mason as waiting; even New York, under such an impression, was
      &ldquo;good,&rdquo; good enough&mdash;for <i>him</i>; its very sounds were faint, were
      almost sweet, as they reached him from so seemingly far beyond the wooded
      horizon that formed the remoter limit of his large shallow glade. The
      tones of the frolic infants ceased to be nondescript and harsh&mdash;were
      in fact almost as fresh and decent as the frilled and puckered and
      ribboned garb of the little girls, which had always a way, in those parts,
      of so portentously flaunting the daughters of the strange native&mdash;that
      is of the overwhelmingly alien&mdash;populace at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that these things in particular were his matter of meditation now; he
      had wanted, at the end of his walk, to sit apart a little and think&mdash;and
      had been doing that for twenty minutes, even though as yet to no break in
      the charm of procrastination. But he had looked without seeing and
      listened without hearing: all that had been positive for him was that he
      hadn&rsquo;t failed vaguely to feel. He had felt in the first place, and he
      continued to feel&mdash;yes, at forty-eight quite as much as at any point
      of the supposed reign of younger intensities&mdash;the great spirit of the
      air, the fine sense of the season, the supreme appeal of Nature, he might
      have said, to his time of life; quite as if she, easy, indulgent,
      indifferent, cynical Power, were offering him the last chance it would
      rest with his wit or his blood to embrace. Then with that he had been
      entertaining, to the point and with the prolonged consequence of accepted
      immobilization, the certitude that if he did call on Mrs. Worthingham and
      find her at home he couldn&rsquo;t in justice to himself not put to her the
      question that had lapsed the other time, the last time, through the
      irritating and persistent, even if accidental, presence of others. What
      friends she had&mdash;the people who so stupidly, so wantonly stuck! If
      they <i>should</i>, he and she, come to an understanding, that would
      presumably have to include certain members of her singularly ill-composed
      circle, in whom it was incredible to him that he should ever take an
      interest. This defeat, to do himself justice&mdash;he had bent rather
      predominantly on <i>that</i>, you see; ideal justice to <i>her</i>, with
      her possible conception of what it should consist of, being another and
      quite a different matter&mdash;he had had the fact of the Sunday afternoon
      to thank for; she didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;keep&rdquo; that day for him, since they hadn&rsquo;t, up to
      now, quite begun to cultivate the appointment or assignation founded on
      explicit sacrifices. He might at any rate look to find this pleasant
      practical Wednesday&mdash;should he indeed, at his actual rate, stay it
      before it ebbed&mdash;more liberally and intendingly given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound he at last most wittingly distinguished in his nook was the
      single deep note of half-past five borne to him from some high-perched
      public clock. He finally got up with the sense that the time from then on
      <i>ought</i> at least to be felt as sacred to him. At this juncture it was&mdash;while
      he stood there shaking his garments, settling his hat, his necktie, his
      shirt-cuffs, fixing the high polish of his fine shoes as if for some
      reflection in it of his straight and spare and grizzled, his refined and
      trimmed and dressed, his altogether distinguished person, that of a
      gentleman abundantly settled, but of a bachelor markedly nervous&mdash;at
      this crisis it was, doubtless, that he at once most measured and least
      resented his predicament. If he should go he would almost to a certainty
      find her, and if he should find her he would almost to a certainty come to
      the point. He wouldn&rsquo;t put it off again&mdash;there was that high
      consideration for him of justice at least to himself. He had never yet
      denied himself anything so apparently fraught with possibilities as the
      idea of proposing to Mrs. Worthingham&mdash;never yet, in other words,
      denied himself anything he had so distinctly wanted to do; and the results
      of that wisdom had remained for him precisely the precious parts of
      experience. Counting only the offers of his honourable hand, these had
      been on three remembered occasions at least the consequence of an impulse
      as sharp and a self-respect as reasoned; a self-respect that hadn&rsquo;t in the
      least suffered, moreover, from the failure of each appeal. He had been met
      in the three cases&mdash;the only ones he at all compared with his present
      case&mdash;by the frank confession that he didn&rsquo;t somehow, charming as he
      was, cause himself to be superstitiously believed in; and the lapse of
      life, afterward, had cleared up many doubts.
    </p>
    <p>
      It <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i> have done, he eventually, he lucidly saw, each time he
      had been refused; and the candour of his nature was such that he could
      live to think of these very passages as a proof of how right he had been&mdash;right,
      that is, to have put himself forward always, by the happiest instinct,
      only in impossible conditions. He had the happy consciousness of having
      exposed the important question to the crucial test, and of having escaped,
      by that persistent logic, a grave mistake. What better proof of his escape
      than the fact that he was now free to renew the all-interesting inquiry,
      and should be exactly, about to do so in different and better conditions?
      The conditions were better by as much more&mdash;as much more of his
      career and character, of his situation, his reputation he could even have
      called it, of his knowledge of life, of his somewhat extended means, of
      his possibly augmented charm, of his certainly improved mind and temper&mdash;as
      was involved in the actual impending settlement. Once he had got into
      motion, once he had crossed the Park and passed out of it, entering, with
      very little space to traverse, one of the short new streets that abutted
      on its east side, his step became that of a man young enough to find
      confidence, quite to find felicity, in the sense, in almost any sense, of
      action. He could still enjoy almost anything, absolutely an unpleasant
      thing, in default of a better, that might still remind him he wasn&rsquo;t so
      old. The standing newness of everything about him would, it was true, have
      weakened this cheer by too much presuming on it; Mrs. Worthingham&rsquo;s house,
      before which he stopped, had that gloss of new money, that glare of a
      piece fresh from the mint and ringing for the first time on any counter,
      which seems to claim for it, in any transaction, something more than the
      &ldquo;face&rdquo; value.
    </p>
    <p>
      This could but be yet more the case for the impression of the observer
      introduced and committed. On our friend&rsquo;s part I mean, after his admission
      and while still in the hall, the sense of the general shining immediacy,
      of the still unhushed clamour of the shock, was perhaps stronger than he
      had ever known it. That broke out from every corner as the high pitch of
      interest, and with a candour that&mdash;no, certainly&mdash;he had never
      seen equalled; every particular expensive object shrieking at him in its
      artless pride that it had just &ldquo;come home.&rdquo; He met the whole vision with
      something of the grimace produced on persons without goggles by the
      passage from a shelter to a blinding light; and if he had&mdash;by a
      perfectly possible chance&mdash;been &ldquo;snap-shotted&rdquo; on the spot, would
      have struck you as showing for his first tribute to the temple of Mrs.
      Worthingham&rsquo;s charming presence a scowl almost of anguish. He wasn&rsquo;t
      constitutionally, it may at once be explained for him, a goggled person;
      and he was condemned, in New York, to this frequent violence of transition&mdash;having
      to reckon with it whenever he went out, as who should say, from himself.
      The high pitch of interest, to his taste, was the pitch of history, the
      pitch of acquired and earned suggestion, the pitch of association, in a
      word; so that he lived by preference, incontestably, if not in a rich
      gloom, which would have been beyond his means and spirits, at least amid
      objects and images that confessed to the tone of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had ever felt that an indispensable presence&mdash;with a need of it
      moreover that interfered at no point with his gentle habit, not to say his
      subtle art, of drawing out what was left him of his youth, of thinly and
      thriftily spreading the rest of that choicest jam-pot of the cupboard of
      consciousness over the remainder of a slice of life still possibly thick
      enough to bear it; or in other words of moving the melancholy limits, the
      significant signs, constantly a little further on, very much as
      property-marks or staked boundaries are sometimes stealthily shifted at
      night. He positively cherished in fact, as against the too inveterate
      gesture of distressfully guarding his eyeballs&mdash;so many New York
      aspects seemed to keep him at it&mdash;an ideal of adjusted appreciation,
      of courageous curiosity, of fairly letting the world about him, a world of
      constant breathless renewals and merciless substitutions, make its flaring
      assault on its own inordinate terms. Newness was value in the piece&mdash;for
      the acquisitor, or at least sometimes might be, even though the act of
      &ldquo;blowing&rdquo; hard, the act marking a heated freshness of arrival, or other
      form of irruption, could never minister to the peace of those already and
      long on the field; and this if only because maturer tone was after all
      most appreciable and most consoling when one staggered back to it,
      wounded, bleeding, blinded, from the riot of the raw&mdash;or, to put the
      whole experience more prettily, no doubt, from excesses of light.

    <p>
      If he went in, however, with something of his more or less inevitable
      scowl, there were really, at the moment, two rather valid reasons for
      screened observation; the first of these being that the whole place seemed
      to reflect as never before the lustre of Mrs. Worthingham&rsquo;s own polished
      and prosperous little person&mdash;to smile, it struck him, with her
      smile, to twinkle not only with the gleam of her lovely teeth, but with
      that of all her rings and brooches and bangles and other gewgaws, to curl
      and spasmodically cluster as in emulation of her charming complicated
      yellow tresses, to surround the most animated of pink-and-white, of
      ruffled and ribboned, of frilled and festooned Dresden china shepherdesses
      with exactly the right system of rococo curves and convolutions and other
      flourishes, a perfect bower of painted and gilded and moulded conceits.
      The second ground of this immediate impression of scenic extravagance,
      almost as if the curtain rose for him to the first act of some small and
      expensively mounted comic opera, was that she hadn&rsquo;t, after all, awaited
      him in fond singleness, but had again just a trifle inconsiderately
      exposed him to the drawback of having to reckon, for whatever design he
      might amiably entertain, with the presence of a third and quite
      superfluous person, a small black insignificant but none the less
      oppressive stranger. It was odd how, on the instant, the little lady
      engaged with her did affect him as comparatively black&mdash;very much as
      if that had absolutely, in such a medium, to be the graceless appearance
      of any item not positively of some fresh shade of a light colour or of
      some pretty pretension to a charming twist. Any witness of their meeting,
      his hostess should surely have felt, would have been a false note in the
      whole rosy glow; but what note so false as that of the dingy little
      presence that she might actually, by a refinement of her perhaps always
      too visible study of effect, have provided as a positive contrast or foil?
      whose name and intervention, moreover, she appeared to be no more moved to
      mention and account for than she might have been to &ldquo;present&rdquo;&mdash;whether
      as stretched at her feet or erect upon disciplined haunches&mdash;some
      shaggy old domesticated terrier or poodle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Extraordinarily, after he had been in the room five minutes&mdash;a space
      of time during which his fellow-visitor had neither budged nor uttered a
      sound&mdash;he had made Mrs. Worthingham out as all at once perfectly
      pleased to see him, completely aware of what he had most in mind, and
      singularly serene in face of his sense of their impediment. It was as if
      for all the world she didn&rsquo;t take it for one, the immobility, to say
      nothing of the seeming equanimity, of their tactless companion; at whom
      meanwhile indeed our friend himself, after his first ruffled perception,
      no more adventured a look than if advised by his constitutional kindness
      that to notice her in any degree would perforce be ungraciously to glower.
      He talked after a fashion with the woman as to whose power to please and
      amuse and serve him, as to whose really quite organised and indicated
      fitness for lighting up his autumn afternoon of life his conviction had
      lately strained itself so clear; but he was all the while carrying on an
      intenser exchange with his own spirit and trying to read into the charming
      creature&rsquo;s behaviour, as he could only call it, some confirmation of his
      theory that she also had her inward flutter and anxiously counted on him.
      He found support, happily for the conviction just named, in the idea, at
      no moment as yet really repugnant to him, the idea bound up in fact with
      the finer essence of her appeal, that she had her own vision too of her
      quality and her price, and that the last appearance she would have liked
      to bristle with was that of being forewarned and eager.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had, if he came to think of it, scarce definitely warned her, and he
      probably wouldn&rsquo;t have taken to her so consciously in the first instance
      without an appreciative sense that, as she was a little person of twenty
      superficial graces, so she was also a little person with her secret pride.
      She might just have planted her mangy lion&mdash;not to say her muzzled
      house-dog&mdash;there in his path as a symbol that she wasn&rsquo;t cheap and
      easy; which would be a thing he couldn&rsquo;t possibly wish his future wife to
      have shown herself in advance, even if to him alone. That she could make
      him put himself such questions was precisely part of the attaching play of
      her iridescent surface, the shimmering interfusion of her various aspects;
      that of her youth with her independence&mdash;her pecuniary perhaps in
      particular, that of her vivacity with her beauty, that of her facility
      above all with her odd novelty; the high modernity, as people appeared to
      have come to call it, that made her so much more &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; in some
      directions than even he, man of the world as he certainly was, could
      pretend to be, though all on a basis of the most unconscious and
      instinctive and luxurious assumption. She was &ldquo;up&rdquo; to everything, aware of
      everything&mdash;if one counted from a short enough time back (from week
      before last, say, and as if quantities of history had burst upon the world
      within the fortnight); she was likewise surprised at nothing, and in that
      direction one might reckon as far ahead as the rest of her lifetime, or at
      any rate as the rest of his, which was all that would concern him: it was
      as if the suitability of the future to her personal and rather pampered
      tastes was what she most took for granted, so that he could see her, for
      all her Dresden-china shoes and her flutter of wondrous befrilled
      contemporary skirts, skip by the side of the coming age as over the floor
      of a ball-room, keeping step with its monstrous stride and prepared for
      every figure of the dance. Her outlook took form to him suddenly as a
      great square sunny window that hung in assured fashion over the immensity
      of life. There rose toward it as from a vast swarming <i>plaza</i> a high
      tide of emotion and sound; yet it was at the same time as if even while he
      looked her light gemmed hand, flashing on him in addition to those other
      things the perfect polish of the prettiest pink finger-nails in the world,
      had touched a spring, the most ingenious of ecent devices for instant
      ease, which dropped half across the scene a soft-coloured mechanical
      blind, a fluttered, fringed awning of charmingly toned silk, such as would
      make a bath of cool shade for the favoured friend leaning with her there&mdash;that
      is for the happy couple itself&mdash;on the balcony. The great view would
      be the prospect and privilege of the very state he coveted&mdash;since
      didn&rsquo;t he covet it?&mdash;the state of being so securely at her side;
      while the wash of privacy, as one might count it, the broad fine brush
      dipped into clear umber and passed, full and wet, straight across the
      strong scheme of colour, would represent the security itself, all the
      uplifted inner elegance, the condition, so ideal, of being shut out from
      nothing and yet of having, so gaily and breezily aloft, none of the burden
      or worry of anything. Thus, as I say, for our friend, the place itself,
      while his vivid impression lasted, portentously opened and spread, and
      what was before him took, to his vision, though indeed at so other a
      crisis, the form of the &ldquo;glimmering square&rdquo; of the poet; yet, for a still
      more remarkable fact, with an incongruous object usurping at a given
      instant the privilege of the frame and seeming, even as he looked, to
      block the view.
    </p>
    <p>
      The incongruous object was a woman&rsquo;s head, crowned with a little sparsely
      feathered black hat, an ornament quite unlike those the women mostly
      noticed by White-Mason were now &ldquo;wearing,&rdquo; and that grew and grew, that
      came nearer and nearer, while it met his eyes, after the manner of images
      in the kinematograph. It had presently loomed so large that he saw nothing
      else&mdash;not only among the things at a considerable distance, the
      things Mrs. Worthingham would eventually, yet unmistakably, introduce him
      to, but among those of this lady&rsquo;s various attributes and appurtenances as
      to which he had been in the very act of cultivating his consciousness. It
      was in the course of another minute the most extraordinary thing in the
      world: everything had altered, dropped, darkened, disappeared; his
      imagination had spread its wings only to feel them flop all grotesquely at
      its sides as he recognised in his hostess&rsquo;s quiet companion, the
      oppressive alien who hadn&rsquo;t indeed interfered with his fanciful flight,
      though she had prevented his immediate declaration and brought about the
      thud, not to say the felt violent shock, of his fall to earth, the
      perfectly plain identity of Cornelia Rasch. It was she who had remained
      there at attention; it was she their companion hadn&rsquo;t introduced; it was
      she he had forborne to face with his fear of incivility. He stared at her&mdash;everything
      else went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why it has been <i>you</i> all this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Rasch fairly turned pale. &ldquo;I was waiting to see if you&rsquo;d know me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear Cornelia&rdquo;&mdash;he came straight out with it&mdash;&ldquo;rather!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she returned with a quick change to red now, &ldquo;from
      having taken much time to look at me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, she even laughed, but he could see how she had felt his
      unconsciousness, poor thing; the acquaintance, quite the friend of his
      youth, as she had been, the associate of his childhood, of his early
      manhood, of his middle age in fact, up to a few years back, not more than
      ten at the most; the associate too of so many of his associates and of
      almost all of his relations, those of the other time, those who had mainly
      gone for ever; the person in short whose noted disappearance, though it
      might have seemed final, had been only of recent seasons. She was present
      again now, all unexpectedly&mdash;he had heard of her having at last, left
      alone after successive deaths and with scant resources, sought economic
      salvation in Europe, the promised land of American thrift&mdash;she was
      present as this almost ancient and this oddly unassertive little rotund
      figure whom one seemed no more obliged to address than if she had been a
      black satin ottoman &ldquo;treated&rdquo; with buttons and gimp; a class of object as
      to which the policy of blindness was imperative. He felt the need of some
      explanatory plea, and before he could think had uttered one at Mrs.
      Worthingham&rsquo;s expense. &ldquo;Why, you see we weren&rsquo;t introduced&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;but I didn&rsquo;t suppose I should have to be named to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear woman, you haven&rsquo;t&mdash;do me that justice!&rdquo; He could at
      least make this point. &ldquo;I felt all the while&mdash;!&rdquo; However, it would
      have taken him long to say what he had been feeling; and he was aware now
      of the pretty projected light of Mrs. Worthingham&rsquo;s wonder. She looked as
      if, out for a walk with her, he had put her to the inconvenience of his
      stopping to speak to a strange woman in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never supposed you knew her!&rdquo;&mdash;it was to him his hostess excused
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This made Miss Rasch spring up, distinctly flushed, distinctly strange to
      behold, but not vulgarly nettled&mdash;Cornelia was incapable of that;
      only rather funnily bridling and laughing, only showing that this was all
      she had waited for, only saying just the right thing, the thing she could
      make so clearly a jest. &ldquo;Of course if you <i>had</i> you&rsquo;d have presented
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Worthingham looked while answering at White-Mason. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want you
      to go&mdash;which you see you do as soon as he speaks to you. But I never
      dreamed&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That there was anything between us? Ah, there are no end of things!&rdquo; He,
      on his side, though addressing the younger and prettier woman, looked at
      his fellow-guest; to whom he even continued: &ldquo;When did you get back? May I
      come and see you the very first thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cornelia gasped and wriggled&mdash;she practically giggled; she had lost
      every atom of her little old, her little young, though always
      unaccountable prettiness, which used to peep so, on the bare chance of a
      shot, from behind indefensible features, that it almost made watching her
      a form of sport. He had heard vaguely of her, it came back to him (for
      there had been no letters; their later acquaintance, thank goodness,
      hadn&rsquo;t involved that) as experimenting, for economy, and then as settling,
      to the same rather dismal end, somewhere in England, &ldquo;at one of those
      intensely English places, St. Leonards, Cheltenham, Bognor, Dawlish&mdash;which,
      awfully, <i>was</i> it?&rdquo;&mdash;and she now affected him for all the world
      as some small squirming, exclaiming, genteelly conversing old maid of a
      type vaguely associated with the three-volume novels he used to feed on
      (besides his so often encountering it in &ldquo;real life,&rdquo;) during a far-away
      stay of his own at Brighton. Odder than any element of his ex-gossip&rsquo;s
      identity itself, however, was the fact that she somehow, with it all,
      rejoiced his sight. Indeed the supreme oddity was that the manner of her
      reply to his request for leave to call should have absolutely charmed his
      attention. She didn&rsquo;t look at him; she only, from under her frumpy, crapy,
      curiously exotic hat, and with her good little near-sighted insinuating
      glare, expressed to Mrs. Worthingham, while she answered him, wonderful
      arch things, the overdone things of a shy woman. &ldquo;Yes, you may call&mdash;but
      only when this dear lovely lady has done with you!&rdquo; The moment after which
      she had gone.

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Forty minutes later he was taking his way back from the queer miscarriage
      of his adventure; taking it, with no conscious positive felicity, through
      the very spaces that had witnessed shortly before the considerable
      serenity of his assurance. He had said to himself then, or had as good as
      said it, that, since he might do perfectly as he liked, it couldn&rsquo;t fail
      for him that he must soon retrace those steps, humming, to all intents,
      the first bars of a wedding-march; so beautifully had it cleared up that
      he was &ldquo;going to like&rdquo; letting Mrs. Worthingham accept him. He was to have
      hummed no wedding-march, as it seemed to be turning out&mdash;he had none,
      up to now, to hum; and yet, extraordinarily, it wasn&rsquo;t in the least
      because she had refused him. Why then hadn&rsquo;t he liked as much as he had
      intended to like it putting the pleasant act, the act of not refusing him,
      in her power? Could it all have come from the awkward minute of his
      failure to decide sharply, on Cornelia&rsquo;s departure, whether or no he would
      attend her to the door? He hadn&rsquo;t decided at all&mdash;what the deuce had
      been in him?&mdash;but had danced to and fro in the room, thinking better
      of each impulse and then thinking worse. He had hesitated like an ass
      erect on absurd hind legs between two bundles of hay; the upshot of which
      must have been his giving the falsest impression. In what way that was to
      be for an instant considered had their common past committed him to crapy
      Cornelia? He repudiated with a whack on the gravel any ghost of an
      obligation.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he could get rid of with scanter success, unfortunately, was the
      peculiar sharpness of his sense that, though mystified by his visible
      flurry&mdash;and yet not mystified enough for a sympathetic question
      either&mdash;his hostess had been, on the whole, even more frankly
      diverted: which was precisely an example of that newest, freshest, finest
      freedom in her, the air and the candour of assuming, not &ldquo;heartlessly,&rdquo;
       not viciously, not even very consciously, but with a bright pampered
      confidence which would probably end by affecting one&rsquo;s nerves as the most
      impertinent stroke in the world, that every blest thing coming up for her
      in any connection was somehow matter for her general recreation. There she
      was again with the innocent egotism, the gilded and overflowing anarchism,
      really, of her doubtless quite unwitting but none the less rabid modern
      note. Her grace of ease was perfect, but it was all grace of ease, not a
      single shred of it grace of uncertainty or of difficulty&mdash;which
      meant, when you came to see, that, for its happy working, not a grain of
      provision was left by it to mere manners. This was clearly going to be the
      music of the future&mdash;that if people were but rich enough and
      furnished enough and fed enough, exercised and sanitated and manicured and
      generally advised and advertised and made &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; enough, <i>avertis</i>
      enough, as the term appeared to be nowadays in Paris, all they had to do
      for civility was to take the amused ironic view of those who might be less
      initiated. In <i>his</i> time, when he was young or even when he was only
      but a little less middle-aged, the best manners had been the best
      kindness, and the best kindness had mostly been some art of not insisting
      on one&rsquo;s luxurious differences, of concealing rather, for common humanity,
      if not for common decency, a part at least of the intensity or the
      ferocity with which one might be &ldquo;in the know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, the &ldquo;know&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Worthingham was in it, all instinctively,
      inevitably, and as a matter of course, up to her eyes; which didn&rsquo;t,
      however, the least little bit prevent her being as ignorant as a fish of
      everything that really and intimately and fundamentally concerned <i>him</i>,
      poor dear old White-Mason. She didn&rsquo;t, in the first place, so much as know
      who he was&mdash;by which he meant know who and what it was to <i>be</i> a
      White-Mason, even a poor and a dear and old one, &ldquo;anyway.&rdquo; That indeed&mdash;he
      did her perfect justice&mdash;was of the very essence of the newness and
      freshness and beautiful, brave, social irresponsibility by which she had
      originally dazzled him: just exactly that circumstance of her having no
      instinct for any old quality or quantity or identity, a single historic or
      social value, as he might say, of the New York of his already almost
      legendary past; and that additional one of his, on his side, having, so
      far as this went, cultivated blankness, cultivated positive prudence, as
      to her own personal background&mdash;the vagueness, at the best, with
      which all honest gentlefolk, the New Yorkers of his approved stock and
      conservative generation, were content, as for the most part they were
      indubitably wise, to surround the origins and antecedents and queer
      unimaginable early influences of persons swimming into their ken from
      those parts of the country that quite necessarily and naturally figured to
      their view as &ldquo;Godforsaken&rdquo; and generally impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The few scattered surviving representatives of a society once &ldquo;good&rdquo;&mdash;<i>rari
      nantes in gurgite vasto</i>&mdash;were liable, at the pass things had come
      to, to meet, and even amid old shades once sacred, or what was left of
      such, every form of social impossibility, and, more irresistibly still, to
      find these apparitions often carry themselves (often at least in the case
      of the women) with a wondrous wild gallantry, equally imperturbable and
      inimitable, the sort of thing that reached its maximum in Mrs.
      Worthingham. Beyond that who ever wanted to look up their annals, to
      reconstruct their steps and stages, to dot their i&rsquo;s in fine, or to &ldquo;go
      behind&rdquo; anything that was theirs? One wouldn&rsquo;t do that for the world&mdash;a
      rudimentary discretion forbade it; and yet this check from elementary
      undiscussable taste quite consorted with a due respect for them, or at any
      rate with a due respect for oneself in connection with them; as was just
      exemplified in what would be his own, what would be poor dear old
      White-Mason&rsquo;s, insurmountable aversion to having, on any pretext, the
      doubtless very queer spectre of the late Mr. Worthingham presented to him.
      No question had he asked, or would he ever ask, should his life&mdash;that
      is should the success of his courtship&mdash;even intimately depend on it,
      either about that obscure agent of his mistress&rsquo;s actual affluence or
      about the happy head-spring itself, and the apparently copious
      tributaries, of the golden stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      From all which marked anomalies, at any rate, what was the moral to draw?
      He dropped into a Park chair again with that question, he lost himself in
      the wonder of why he had come away with his homage so very much unpaid.
      Yet it didn&rsquo;t seem at all, actually, as if he could say or conclude, as if
      he could do anything but keep on worrying&mdash;just in conformity with
      his being a person who, whether or no familiar with the need to make his
      conduct square with his conscience and his taste, was never wholly exempt
      from that of making his taste and his conscience square with his conduct.
      To this latter occupation he further abandoned himself, and it didn&rsquo;t
      release him from his second brooding session till the sweet spring sunset
      had begun to gather and he had more or less cleared up, in the deepening
      dusk, the effective relation between the various parts of his ridiculously
      agitating experience. There were vital facts he seemed thus to catch, to
      seize, with a nervous hand, and the twilight helping, by their vaguely
      whisked tails; unquiet truths that swarmed out after the fashion of
      creatures bold only at eventide, creatures that hovered and circled, that
      verily brushed his nose, in spite of their shyness. Yes, he had
      practically just sat on with his &ldquo;mistress&rdquo;&mdash;heaven save the mark!&mdash;as
      if not to come to the point; as if it had absolutely come up that there
      would be something rather vulgar and awful in doing so. The whole stretch
      of his stay after Cornelia&rsquo;s withdrawal had been consumed by his almost
      ostentatiously treating himself to the opportunity of which he was to make
      nothing. It was as if he had sat and watched himself&mdash;that came back
      to him: Shall I now or sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t I? Will I now or won&rsquo;t I? &ldquo;Say within the
      next three minutes, say by a quarter past six, or by twenty minutes past,
      at the furthest&mdash;always if nothing more comes up to prevent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What had already come up to prevent was, in the strangest and drollest, or
      at least in the most preposterous, way in the world, that not Cornelia&rsquo;s
      presence, but her very absence, with its distraction of his thoughts, the
      thoughts that lumbered after her, had made the difference; and without his
      being the least able to tell why and how. He put it to himself after a
      fashion by the image that, this distraction once created, his working
      round to his hostess again, his reverting to the matter of his errand,
      began suddenly to represent a return from so far. That was simply all&mdash;or
      rather a little less than all; for something else had contributed. &ldquo;I
      never dreamed you knew her,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I never dreamed <i>you</i> did,&rdquo; were
      inevitably what had been exchanged between them&mdash;supplemented by Mrs.
      Worthingham&rsquo;s mere scrap of an explanation: &ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;to the small
      extent you see. Two years ago in Switzerland when I was at a high place
      for an &lsquo;aftercure,&rsquo; during twenty days of incessant rain, she was the only
      person in an hotel full of roaring, gorging, smoking Germans with whom I
      could have a word of talk. She and I were the only speakers of English,
      and were thrown together like castaways on a desert island and in a raging
      storm. She was ill besides, and she had no maid, and mine looked after
      her, and she was very grateful&mdash;writing to me later on and saying she
      should certainly come to see me if she ever returned to New York. She has
      returned, you see&mdash;and there she was, poor little creature!&rdquo; Such was
      Mrs. Worthingham&rsquo;s tribute&mdash;to which even his asking her if Miss
      Rasch had ever happened to speak of him caused her practically to add
      nothing. Visibly she had never thought again of any one Miss Rasch had
      spoken of or anything Miss Rasch had said; right as she was, naturally,
      about her being a little clever queer creature. This was perfectly true,
      and yet it was probably&mdash;by being <i>all</i> she could dream of about
      her&mdash;what had paralysed his proper gallantry. Its effect had been not
      in what it simply stated, but in what, under his secretly disintegrating
      criticism, it almost luridly symbolised.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had quitted his seat in the Louis Quinze drawing-room without having,
      as he would have described it, done anything but give the lady of the
      scene a superior chance not to betray a defeated hope&mdash;not, that is,
      to fail of the famous &ldquo;pride&rdquo; mostly supposed to prop even the most
      infatuated women at such junctures; by which chance, to do her justice,
      she had thoroughly seemed to profit. But he finally rose from his later
      station with a feeling of better success. He had by a happy turn of his
      hand got hold of the most precious, the least obscure of the flitting,
      circling things that brushed his ears. What he wanted&mdash;as justifying
      for him a little further consideration&mdash;was there before him from the
      moment he could put it that Mrs. Worthingham had no data. He almost hugged
      that word,&mdash;it suddenly came to mean so much to him. No data, he
      felt, for a conception of the sort of thing the New York of &ldquo;his time&rdquo; had
      been in his personal life&mdash;the New York so unexpectedly, so vividly
      and, as he might say, so perversely called back to all his senses by its
      identity with that of poor Cornelia&rsquo;s time: since even she had had a time,
      small show as it was likely to make now, and his time and hers had been
      the same. Cornelia figured to him while he walked away as, by contrast and
      opposition, a massive little bundle of data; his impatience to go to see
      her sharpened as he thought of this: so certainly should he find out that
      wherever he might touch her, with a gentle though firm pressure, he would,
      as the fond visitor of old houses taps and fingers a disfeatured,
      overpapered wall with the conviction of a wainscot-edge beneath, recognise
      some small extrusion of history.

      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      There would have been a wonder for us meanwhile in his continued use, as
      it were, of his happy formula&mdash;brought out to Cornelia Rasch within
      ten minutes, or perhaps only within twenty, of his having settled into the
      quite comfortable chair that, two days later, she indicated to him by her
      fireside. He had arrived at her address through the fortunate chance of
      his having noticed her card, as he went out, deposited, in the good old
      New York fashion, on one of the rococo tables of Mrs. Worthingham&rsquo;s hall.
      His eye had been caught by the pencilled indication that was to affect
      him, the next instant, as fairly placed there for his sake. This had
      really been his luck, for he shouldn&rsquo;t have liked to write to Mrs.
      Worthingham for guidance&mdash;<i>that</i> he felt, though too impatient
      just now to analyze the reluctance. There was nobody else he could have
      approached for a clue, and with this reflection he was already aware of
      how it testified to their rare little position, his and Cornelia&rsquo;s&mdash;position
      as conscious, ironic, pathetic survivors together of a dead and buried
      society&mdash;that there would have been, in all the town, under such
      stress, not a member of their old circle left to turn to. Mrs. Worthingham
      had practically, even if accidentally, helped him to knowledge; the last
      nail in the coffin of the poor dear extinct past had been planted for him
      by his having thus to reach his antique contemporary through perforation
      of the newest newness. The note of this particular recognition was in fact
      the more prescribed to him that the ground of Cornelia&rsquo;s return to a scene
      swept so bare of the associational charm was certainly inconspicuous. What
      had she then come back for?&mdash;he had asked himself that; with the
      effect of deciding that it probably would have been, a little, to &ldquo;look
      after&rdquo; her remnant of property. Perhaps she had come to save what little
      might still remain of that shrivelled interest; perhaps she had been, by
      those who took care of it for her, further swindled and despoiled, so that
      she wished to get at the facts. Perhaps on the other hand&mdash;it was a
      more cheerful chance&mdash;her investments, decently administered, were
      making larger returns, so that the rigorous thrift of Bognor could be
      finally relaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had little to learn about the attraction of Europe, and rather expected
      that in the event of his union with Mrs Worthingham he should find himself
      pleading for it with the competence of one more in the &ldquo;know&rdquo; about Paris
      and Rome, about Venice and Florence, than even she could be. He could have
      lived on in <i>his</i> New York, that is in the sentimental, the
      spiritual, the more or less romantic visitation of it; but had it been
      positive for him that he could live on in hers?&mdash;unless indeed the
      possibility of this had been just (like the famous <i>vertige de l&rsquo;abîme</i>,
      like the solicitation of danger, or otherwise of the dreadful) the very
      hinge of his whole dream. However that might be, his curiosity was
      occupied rather with the conceivable hinge of poor Cornelia&rsquo;s: it was
      perhaps thinkable that even Mrs. Worthingham&rsquo;s New York, once it should
      have become possible again at all, might have put forth to this lone exile
      a plea that wouldn&rsquo;t be in the chords of Bognor. For himself, after all,
      too, the attraction had been much more of the Europe over which one might
      move at one&rsquo;s ease, and which therefore could but cost, and cost much,
      right and left, than of the Europe adapted to scrimping. He saw himself on
      the whole scrimping with more zest even in Mrs. Worthingham&rsquo;s New York
      than under the inspiration of Bognor. Apart from which it was yet again
      odd, not to say perceptibly pleasing to him, to note where the emphasis of
      his interest fell in this fumble of fancy over such felt oppositions as
      the new, the latest, the luridest power of money and the ancient reserves
      and moderations and mediocrities. These last struck him as showing by
      contrast the old brown surface and tone as of velvet rubbed and worn,
      shabby, and even a bit dingy, but all soft and subtle and still velvety&mdash;which
      meant still dignified; whereas the angular facts of current finance were
      as harsh and metallic and bewildering as some stacked &ldquo;exhibit&rdquo; of ugly
      patented inventions, things his mediaeval mind forbade his taking in. He
      had for instance the sense of knowing the pleasant little old Rasch
      fortune&mdash;pleasant as far as it went; blurred memories and impressions
      of what it had been and what it hadn&rsquo;t, of how it had grown and how
      languished and how melted; they came back to him and put on such vividness
      that he could almost have figured himself testify for them before a bland
      and encouraging Board. The idea of taking the field in any manner on the
      subject of Mrs. Worthingham&rsquo;s resources would have affected him on the
      other hand as an odious ordeal, some glare of embarrassment and exposure
      in a circle of hard unhelpful attention, of converging, derisive,
      unsuggestive eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Cornelia&rsquo;s small and quite cynically modern flat&mdash;the house had a
      grotesque name, &ldquo;The Gainsborough,&rdquo; but at least wasn&rsquo;t an awful
      boarding-house, as he had feared, and she could receive him quite
      honourably, which was so much to the good&mdash;he would have been ready
      to use at once to her the greatest freedom of friendly allusion: &ldquo;Have you
      still your old &lsquo;family interest&rsquo; in those two houses in Seventh Avenue?&mdash;one
      of which was next to a corner grocery, don&rsquo;t you know? and was occupied as
      to its lower part by a candy-shop where the proportion of the stock of
      suspectedly stale popcorn to that of rarer and stickier joys betrayed
      perhaps a modest capital on the part of your father&rsquo;s, your grandfather&rsquo;s,
      or whoever&rsquo;s tenant, but out of which I nevertheless remember once to have
      come as out of a bath of sweets, with my very garments, and even the
      separate hairs of my head, glued together. The other of the pair, a
      tobacconist&rsquo;s, further down, had before it a wonderful huge Indian who
      thrust out wooden cigars at an indifferent world&mdash;you could buy candy
      cigars too, at the pop-corn shop, and I greatly preferred them to the
      wooden; I remember well how I used to gape in fascination at the Indian
      and wonder if the last of the Mohicans was like him; besides admiring so
      the resources of a family whose &lsquo;property&rsquo; was in such forms. I haven&rsquo;t
      been round there lately&mdash;we must go round together; but don&rsquo;t tell me
      the forms have utterly perished!&rdquo; It was after <i>that</i> fashion he
      might easily have been moved, and with almost no transition, to break out
      to Cornelia&mdash;quite as if taking up some old talk, some old community
      of gossip, just where they had left it; even with the consciousness
      perhaps of overdoing a little, of putting at its maximum, for the present
      harmony, recovery, recapture (what should he call it?) the pitch and
      quantity of what the past had held for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He didn&rsquo;t in fact, no doubt, dart straight off to Seventh Avenue, there
      being too many other old things and much nearer and long subsequent; the
      point was only that for everything they spoke of after he had fairly begun
      to lean back and stretch his legs, and after she had let him, above all,
      light the first of a succession of cigarettes&mdash;for everything they
      spoke of he positively cultivated extravagance and excess, piling up the
      crackling twigs as on the very altar of memory; and that by the end of
      half an hour she had lent herself, all gallantly, to their game. It was
      the game of feeding the beautiful iridescent flame, ruddy and green and
      gold, blue and pink and amber and silver, with anything they could pick
      up, anything that would burn and flicker. Thick-strown with such gleanings
      the occasion seemed indeed, in spite of the truth that they perhaps
      wouldn&rsquo;t have proved, under cross-examination, to have rubbed shoulders in
      the other life so very hard. Casual contacts, qualified communities
      enough, there had doubtless been, but not particular &ldquo;passages,&rdquo; nothing
      that counted, as he might think of it, for their &ldquo;very own&rdquo; together, for
      nobody&rsquo;s else at all. These shades of historic exactitude didn&rsquo;t signify;
      the more and the less that there had been made perfect terms&mdash;and
      just by his being there and by her rejoicing in it&mdash;with their
      present need to have <i>had</i> all their past could be made to appear to
      have given them. It was to this tune they proceeded, the least little bit
      as if they knowingly pretended&mdash;he giving her the example and setting
      her the pace of it, and she, poor dear, after a first inevitable shyness,
      an uncertainty of wonder, a breathlessness of courage, falling into step
      and going whatever length he would.
    </p>
    <p>
      She showed herself ready for it, grasping gladly at the perception of what
      he must mean; and if she didn&rsquo;t immediately and completely fall in&mdash;not
      in the first half-hour, not even in the three or four others that his
      visit, even whenever he consulted his watch, still made nothing of&mdash;she
      yet understood enough as soon as she understood that, if their finer
      economy hadn&rsquo;t so beautifully served, he might have been conveying this,
      that, and the other incoherent and easy thing by the comparatively clumsy
      method of sound and statement. &ldquo;No, I never made love to you; it would in
      fact have been absurd, and I don&rsquo;t care&mdash;though I almost know, in the
      sense of almost remembering!&mdash;who did and who didn&rsquo;t; but you were
      always about, and so was I, and, little as you may yourself care who I did
      it to, I dare say you remember (in the sense of having known of it!) any
      old appearances that told. But we can&rsquo;t afford at this time of day not to
      help each other to have had&mdash;well, everything there was, since
      there&rsquo;s no more of it now, nor any way of coming by it except so; and
      therefore let us make together, let us make over and recreate, our lost
      world; for which we have after all and at the worst such a lot of
      material. You were in particular my poor dear sisters&rsquo; friend&mdash;they
      thought you the funniest little brown thing possible; so isn&rsquo;t that again
      to the good? You were mine only to the extent that you were so much in and
      out of the house&mdash;as how much, if we come to that, wasn&rsquo;t one in and
      out, south of Thirtieth Street and north of Washington Square, in those
      days, those spacious, sociable, Arcadian days, that we flattered ourselves
      we filled with the modern fever, but that were so different from any of
      these arrangements of pretended hourly Time that dash themselves forever
      to pieces as from the fiftieth floors of sky-scrapers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the kind of thing that was in the air, whether he said it or not,
      and that could hang there even with such quite other things as more
      crudely came out; came in spite of its being perhaps calculated to strike
      us that these last would have been rather and most the unspoken and the
      indirect. They were Cornelia&rsquo;s contribution, and as soon as she had begun
      to talk of Mrs. Worthingham&mdash;<i>he</i> didn&rsquo;t begin it!&mdash;they
      had taken their place bravely in the centre of the circle. There they
      made, the while, their considerable little figure, but all within the ring
      formed by fifty other allusions, fitful but really intenser irruptions
      that hovered and wavered and came and went, joining hands at moments and
      whirling round as in chorus, only then again to dash at the slightly
      huddled centre with a free twitch or peck or push or other taken liberty,
      after the fashion of irregular frolic motions in a country dance or a
      Christmas game.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so in love with her and want to marry her!&rdquo;&mdash;she said it all
      sympathetically and yearningly, poor crapy Cornelia; as if it were to be
      quite taken for granted that she knew all about it. And then when he had
      asked how she knew&mdash;why she took so informed a tone about it; all on
      the wonder of her seeming so much more &ldquo;in&rdquo; it just at that hour than he
      himself quite felt he could figure for: &ldquo;Ah, how but from the dear lovely
      thing herself? Don&rsquo;t you suppose <i>she</i> knows it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she absolutely &lsquo;knows&rsquo; it, does she?&rdquo;&mdash;he fairly heard himself
      ask that; and with the oddest sense at once of sharply wanting the
      certitude and yet of seeing the question, of hearing himself say the
      words, through several thicknesses of some wrong medium. He came back to
      it from a distance; as he would have had to come back (this was again
      vivid to him) should he have got round again to his ripe intention three
      days before&mdash;after his now present but then absent friend, that is,
      had left him planted before his now absent but then present one for the
      purpose. &ldquo;Do you mean she&mdash;at all confidently!&mdash;expects?&rdquo; he
      went on, not much minding if it couldn&rsquo;t but sound foolish; the time being
      given it for him meanwhile by the sigh, the wondering gasp, all charged
      with the unutterable, that the tone of his appeal set in motion. He saw
      his companion look at him, but it might have been with the eyes of thirty
      years ago; when&mdash;very likely.&mdash;he had put her some such question
      about some girl long since dead. Dimly at first, then more distinctly,
      didn&rsquo;t it surge back on him for the very strangeness that there had been
      some such passage as this between them&mdash;yes, about Mary Cardew!&mdash;in
      the autumn of &lsquo;68?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you realise your situation?&rdquo; Miss Rasch struck him as quite
      beautifully wailing&mdash;above all to such an effect of deep interest,
      that is, on her own part and in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My situation?&rdquo;&mdash;he echoed, he considered; but reminded afresh, by
      the note of the detached, the far-projected in it, of what he had last
      remembered of his sentient state on his once taking ether at the
      dentist&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours and hers&mdash;the situation of her adoring you. I suppose you at
      least know it,&rdquo; Cornelia smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was like the other time and yet it wasn&rsquo;t. She was like&mdash;poor
      Cornelia was&mdash;everything that used to be; that somehow was most
      definite to him. Still he could quite reply &ldquo;Do you call it&mdash;her
      adoring me&mdash;<i>my</i> situation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a part of yours, surely&mdash;if you&rsquo;re in love with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I, ridiculous old person! in love with her?&rdquo; White-Mason asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may be a ridiculous old person,&rdquo; Cornelia returned&mdash;&ldquo;and, for that
      matter, of course I am! But she&rsquo;s young and lovely and rich and clever: so
      what could be more natural?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I was applying that opprobrious epithet&mdash;!&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t finish,
      though he meant he had applied it to himself. He had got up from his seat;
      he turned about and, taking in, as his eyes also roamed, several objects
      in the room, serene and sturdy, not a bit cheap-looking, little old New
      York objects of &lsquo;68, he made, with an inner art, as if to recognise them&mdash;made
      so, that is, for himself; had quite the sense for the moment of asking
      them, of imploring them, to recognise <i>him</i>, to be for him things of
      his own past. Which they truly were, he could have the next instant cried
      out; for it meant that if three or four of them, small sallow
      carte-de-visite photographs, faithfully framed but spectrally faded,
      hadn&rsquo;t in every particular, frames and balloon skirts and false &ldquo;property&rdquo;
       balustrades of unimaginable terraces and all, the tone of time, the secret
      for warding and easing off the perpetual imminent ache of one&rsquo;s protective
      scowl, one would verily but have to let the scowl stiffen, or to take up
      seriously the question of blue goggles, during what might remain of life.

      What he actually took up from a little old Twelfth-Street table that
      piously preserved the plain mahogany circle, with never a curl nor a crook
      nor a hint of a brazen flourish, what he paused there a moment for
      commerce with, his back presented to crapy Cornelia, who sat taking that
      view of him, during this opportunity, very protrusively and frankly and
      fondly, was one of the wasted mementos just mentioned, over which he both
      uttered and suppressed a small comprehensive cry. He stood there another
      minute to look at it, and when he turned about still kept it in his hand,
      only holding it now a litde behind him. &ldquo;You <i>must</i> have come back to
      stay&mdash;with all your beautiful things. What else does it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Beautiful&rsquo;?&rdquo; his old friend commented with her brow all wrinkled and her
      lips thrust out in expressive dispraise. They might at that rate have been
      scarce more beautiful than she herself. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t talk so&mdash;after
      Mrs. Worthingham&rsquo;s! <i>They&rsquo;re</i> wonderful, if you will: such things,
      such things! But one&rsquo;s own poor relics and odds and ends are one&rsquo;s own at
      least; and one <i>has</i>&mdash;yes&mdash;come back to them. They&rsquo;re all I
      have in the world to come back to. They were stored, and what I was paying&mdash;!&rdquo;
       Miss Rasch wofully added.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had possession of the small old picture; he hovered there; he put his
      eyes again to it intently; then again held it a little behind him as if it
      might have been snatched away or the very feel of it, pressed against him,
      was good to his palm. &ldquo;Mrs. Worthingham&rsquo;s things? You think them
      beautiful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cornelia did now, if ever, show an odd face. &ldquo;Why certainly prodigious, or
      whatever. Isn&rsquo;t that conceded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt every horror, at the pass we&rsquo;ve come to, is conceded. That&rsquo;s
      just what I complain of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you <i>complain?</i>&rdquo;&mdash;she drew it out as for surprise: she
      couldn&rsquo;t have imagined such a thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me her things are awful. They&rsquo;re the newest of the new.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but the old forms!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those are the most blatant. I mean the swaggering reproductions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh but,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t all be <i>really</i> old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we can&rsquo;t, Cornelia. But <i>you</i> can&mdash;!&rdquo; said White-Mason with
      the frankest appreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him from where she sat as he could imagine her looking up
      at the curate at Bognor. &ldquo;Thank you, sir! If that&rsquo;s all you want&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i>&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;all I want&mdash;or almost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then no wonder such a creature as that,&rdquo; she lightly moralised, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t
      suit you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bent upon her, for all the weight of his question, his smoothest stare.
      &ldquo;You hold she certainly won&rsquo;t suit me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what can I tell about it? Haven&rsquo;t you by this time found out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I think I&rsquo;m finding.&rdquo; With which he began again to explore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Rasch immensely wondered. &ldquo;You mean you don&rsquo;t expect to come to an
      understanding with her?&rdquo; And then as even to this straight challenge he
      made at first no answer: &ldquo;Do you mean you give it up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited some instants more, but not meeting her eyes&mdash;only looking
      again about the room. &ldquo;What do you think of my chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; his companion cried, &ldquo;what has what I think to do with it? How can I
      think anything but that she must like you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;of course. But how much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t you really know?&rdquo; Cornelia asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept up his walk, oddly preoccupied and still not looking at her. &ldquo;Do
      you, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waited a little. &ldquo;If you haven&rsquo;t really put it to her I don&rsquo;t suppose
      she knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This at last arrested him again. &ldquo;My dear Cornelia, she doesn&rsquo;t know&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had paused as for the desperate tone, or at least the large emphasis of
      it, so that she took him up. &ldquo;The more reason then to help her to find it
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;that she doesn&rsquo;t know anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything else, I mean&mdash;even if she does know <i>that</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cornelia considered of it. &ldquo;But what else need she&mdash;in particular&mdash;know?
      Isn&rsquo;t that the principal thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;and he resumed his circuit&mdash;&ldquo;she doesn&rsquo;t know anything
      that we know. But nothing,&rdquo; he re-emphasised&mdash;&ldquo;nothing whatever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, can&rsquo;t she do without that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently she can&mdash;and evidently she does, beautifully. But the
      question is whether <i>I</i> can!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had paused once more with his point&mdash;but she glared, poor
      Cornelia, with her wonder. &ldquo;Surely if you know for yourself&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, it doesn&rsquo;t seem enough for me to know for myself! One wants a woman,&rdquo;
       he argued&mdash;but still, in his prolonged tour, quite without his scowl&mdash;&ldquo;to
      know <i>for</i> one, to know <i>with</i> one. That&rsquo;s what you do now,&rdquo; he
      candidly put to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It made her again gape. &ldquo;Do you mean you want to marry <i>me?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was so full of what he did mean, however, that he failed even to notice
      it. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t in the least know, for instance, how old I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re so young!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, there you are!&rdquo;&mdash;and he turned off afresh and as if almost in
      disgust. It left her visibly perplexed&mdash;though even the perplexed
      Cornelia was still the exceedingly pointed; but he had come to her aid
      after another turn. &ldquo;Remember, please, that I&rsquo;m pretty well as old as
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had all her point at least, while she bridled and blinked, for this.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re exactly a year and ten months older.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It checked him there for delight. &ldquo;You remember my birthday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She twinkled indeed like some far-off light of home. &ldquo;I remember every
      one&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s a little way I&rsquo;ve always had&mdash;and that I&rsquo;ve never lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her accomplishment, across the room, as at some striking,
      some charming phenomenon. &ldquo;Well, <i>that&rsquo;s</i> the sort of thing I want!&rdquo;
       All the ripe candour of his eyes confirmed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could she do therefore, she seemed to ask him, but repeat her
      question of a moment before?&mdash;which indeed presently she made up her
      mind to. &ldquo;Do you want to marry <i>me?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It had this time better success&mdash;if the term may be felt in any
      degree to apply. All his candour, or more of it at least, was in his slow,
      mild, kind, considering head-shake. &ldquo;No, Cornelia&mdash;not to <i>marry</i>
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His discrimination was a wonder; but since she was clearly treating him
      now as if everything about him was, so she could as exquisitely meet it.
      &ldquo;Not at least,&rdquo; she convulsively smiled, &ldquo;until you&rsquo;ve honourably tried
      Mrs. Worthingham. Don&rsquo;t you really <i>mean</i> to?&rdquo; she gallantly
      insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited again a little; then he brought out: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you presently.&rdquo;
       He came back, and as by still another mere glance over the room, to what
      seemed to him so much nearer. &ldquo;That table was old Twelfth-Street?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything here was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the pure blessings! With you, ah, with you, I haven&rsquo;t to wear a green
      shade.&rdquo; And he had retained meanwhile his small photograph, which he again
      showed himself. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t we talk of Mary Cardew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, do you remember it?&rdquo; She marvelled to extravagance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make me. You connect me with it. You connect it with we.&rdquo; He liked to
      display to her this excellent use she thus had, the service she rendered.
      &ldquo;There are so many connections&mdash;there will be so many. I feel how,
      with you, they must all come up again for me: in fact you&rsquo;re bringing them
      out already, just while I look at you, as fast as ever you can. The fact
      that you knew every one&mdash;!&rdquo; he went on; yet as if there were more in
      that too than he could quite trust himself about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I knew every one,&rdquo; said Cornelia Rasch; but this time with perfect
      simplicity. &ldquo;I knew, I imagine, more than you do&mdash;or more than you
      did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It kept him there, it made him wonder with his eyes on her. &ldquo;Things about
      <i>them</i>&mdash;our people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our people. Ours only now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah, such an interest as he felt in this&mdash;taking from her while, so
      far from scowling, he almost gaped, all it might mean! &ldquo;Ours indeed&mdash;and
      it&rsquo;s awfully good they are; or that we&rsquo;re still here for them! Nobody else
      is&mdash;nobody but you: not a cat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I <i>am</i> a cat!&rdquo; Cornelia grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean you can tell me things&mdash;?&rdquo; It was too beautiful to
      believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About what really <i>was?</i>&rdquo; she artfully considered, holding him
      immensely now. &ldquo;Well, unless they&rsquo;ve come to you with time; unless you&rsquo;ve
      learned&mdash;or found out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he reassuringly cried&mdash;reassuringly, it most seemed, for
      himself&mdash;&ldquo;nothing has come to me with time, everything has gone from
      me. How can I find out now! What creature has an idea&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw up her hands with the shrug of old days&mdash;the sharp little
      shrug his sisters used to imitate and that she hadn&rsquo;t had to go to Europe
      for. The only thing was that he blessed her for bringing it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the ideas of people now&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, their ideas are certainly not about us&rdquo; But he ruefully faced it.
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve none the less, however, to live with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With their ideas&mdash;?&rdquo; Cornelia questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With <i>them</i>&mdash;these modern wonders; such as they are!&rdquo; Then he
      went on: &ldquo;It must have been to help me you&rsquo;ve come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing for an instant about that, only nodding instead at his
      photograph. &ldquo;What has become of yours? I mean of <i>her</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time it made him turn pale. &ldquo;You remember I <i>have</i> one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kept her eyes on him. &ldquo;In a &lsquo;pork-pie&rsquo; hat, with her hair in a long
      net. That was so &lsquo;smart&rsquo; then; especially with one&rsquo;s skirt looped up, over
      one&rsquo;s hooped magenta petticoat, in little festoons, and a row of very big
      onyx beads over one&rsquo;s braided velveteen sack&mdash;braided quite plain and
      very broad, don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled for her extraordinary possession of these things&mdash;she was
      as prompt as if she had had them before her. &ldquo;Oh, rather&mdash;&lsquo;don&rsquo;t I
      know?&rsquo; You wore brown velveteen, and, on those remarkably small hands,
      funny gauntlets&mdash;like mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do <i>you</i> remember? But like yours?&rdquo; she wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean like hers in my photograph.&rdquo; But he came back to the present
      picture. &ldquo;This is better, however, for really showing her lovely head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary&rsquo;s head was a perfection!&rdquo; Cornelia testified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;it was better than her heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I was fair?&rdquo; It interested him immensely&mdash;and the
      more that he indeed mightn&rsquo;t have been; which he seemed somehow almost to
      hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t think so&mdash;to the very end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;&mdash;ah the right things Cornelia said to him! But before
      she could answer he was studying again closely the small faded face. &ldquo;No,
      she doesn&rsquo;t, she doesn&rsquo;t. Oh, her charming sad eyes and the way they say
      that, across the years, straight into mine! But I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t
      know!&rdquo; White-Mason quite comfortably sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion appeared to appreciate this effect. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the way you
      used to flirt with her, poor thing. Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to have it?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This&mdash;for my very own?&rdquo; He looked up delighted. &ldquo;I really may?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;ll give me yours. We&rsquo;ll exchange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a charming idea. We&rsquo;ll exchange. But you must come and get it at
      my rooms&mdash;where you&rsquo;ll see my things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a little she made no answer&mdash;as if for some feeling. Then she
      said: &ldquo;You asked me just now why I&rsquo;ve come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared as for the connection; after which with a smile: &ldquo;Not to do <i>that</i>&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waited briefly again, but with a queer little look. &ldquo;I can do those
      things now; and&mdash;yes!&mdash;that&rsquo;s in a manner why. I came,&rdquo; she then
      said, &ldquo;because I knew of a sudden one day&mdash;knew as never before&mdash;that
      I was old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. I see.&rdquo; He quite understood&mdash;she had notes that so struck
      him. &ldquo;And how did you like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated&mdash;she decided. &ldquo;Well, if I liked it, it was on the
      principle perhaps on which some people like high game!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;High game&mdash;that&rsquo;s good!&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;Ah, my dear, we&rsquo;re &lsquo;high&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;No, not you&mdash;yet. I at any rate didn&rsquo;t want any
      more adventures,&rdquo; Cornelia said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He showed their small relic again with assurance. &ldquo;You wanted <i>us</i>.
      Then here we are. Oh how we can talk!&mdash;with all those things you
      know! You are an invention. And you&rsquo;ll see there are things J know. I
      shall turn up here&mdash;well, daily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took it in, but only after a moment answered. &ldquo;There was something you
      said just now you&rsquo;d tell me. Don&rsquo;t you mean to try&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Worthingham?&rdquo; He drew from within his coat his pocket-book and
      carefully found a place in it for Mary Cardew&rsquo;s carte-de-visite, folding
      it together with deliberation over which he put it back. Finally he spoke.
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I&rsquo;ve decided. I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cornelia marvelled&mdash;or looked as if she did. &ldquo;Not for all she has?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I know all she has. But I also know all she hasn&rsquo;t. And, as I
      told you, she herself doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;hasn&rsquo;t a glimmer of a suspicion of it;
      and never will have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cornelia magnanimously thought &ldquo;No&mdash;but she knows other things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head as at the portentous heap of them. &ldquo;Too many&mdash;too
      many. And other indeed&mdash;<i>so</i> other! Do you know,&rdquo; he went on,
      &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s as if <i>you</i>&mdash;by turning up for me&mdash;had brought
      that home to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;For you,&rsquo;&rdquo; she candidly considered. &ldquo;But what&mdash;since you can&rsquo;t
      marry me!&mdash;can you do with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, he seemed to have it all. &ldquo;Everything. I can live with you&mdash;just
      this way.&rdquo; To illustrate which he dropped into the other chair by her
      fire; where, leaning back, he gazed at the flame. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give you up.
      It&rsquo;s very curious. It has come over me as it did over you when you
      renounced Bognor. That&rsquo;s it&mdash;I know it at last, and I see one can
      like it. I&rsquo;m &lsquo;high.&rsquo; You needn&rsquo;t deny it. That&rsquo;s my taste. I&rsquo;m old.&rdquo; And
      in spite of the considerable glow there of her little household altar he
      said it without the scowl.

    <p>
      SHE had practically, he believed, conveyed the intimation, the horrid,
      brutal, vulgar menace, in the course of their last dreadful conversation,
      when, for whatever was left him of pluck or confidence&mdash;confidence in
      what he would fain have called a little more aggressively the strength of
      his position&mdash;he had judged best not to take it up. But this time
      there was no question of not understanding, or of pretending he didn&rsquo;t;
      the ugly, the awful words, ruthlessly formed by her lips, were like the
      fingers of a hand that she might have thrust into her pocket for
      extraction of the monstrous object that would serve best for&mdash;what
      should he call it?&mdash;a gage of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I haven&rsquo;t a very different answer from you within the next three days
      I shall put the matter into the hands of my solicitor, whom it may
      interest you to know I&rsquo;ve already seen. I shall bring an action for
      &lsquo;breach&rsquo; against you, Herbert Dodd, as sure as my name&rsquo;s Kate Cookham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There it was, straight and strong&mdash;yet he felt he could say for
      himself, when once it had come, or even, already, just as it was coming,
      that it turned on, as if she had moved an electric switch, the very
      brightest light of his own very reasons. There <i>she</i> was, in all the
      grossness of her native indelicacy, in all her essential excess of will
      and destitution of scruple; and it was the woman capable of that ignoble
      threat who, his sharper sense of her quality having become so quite
      deterrent, was now making for him a crime of it that he shouldn&rsquo;t wish to
      tie himself to her for life. The vivid, lurid thing was the reality, all
      unmistakable, of her purpose; she had thought her case well out; had
      measured its odious, specious presentability; had taken, he might be sure,
      the very best advice obtainable at Properley, where there was always a
      first-rate promptitude of everything fourth-rate; it was disgustingly
      certain, in short, that she&rsquo;d proceed. She was sharp and adroit, moreover&mdash;distinctly
      in certain ways a master-hand; how otherwise, with her so limited mere
      attractiveness, should she have entangled him? He couldn&rsquo;t shut his eyes
      to the very probable truth that if she should try it she&rsquo;d pull it off.
      She <i>knew</i> she would&mdash;precisely; and her assurance was thus the
      very proof of her cruelty. That she had pretended she loved him was
      comparatively nothing; other women had pretended it, and other women too
      had really done it; but that she had pretended he could possibly have been
      right and safe and blest in loving <i>her</i>, a creature of the kind who
      could sniff that squalor of the law-court, of claimed damages and brazen
      lies and published kisses, of love-letters read amid obscene guffaws, as a
      positive tonic to resentment, as a high incentive to her course&mdash;this
      was what put him so beautifully in the right It was what might signify in
      a woman all through, he said to himself, the mere imagination of such
      machinery. Truly what a devilish conception and what an appalling nature!
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was no doubt, luckily, either, that he <i>could</i> plant his
      feet the firmer for his now intensified sense of these things. He was to
      live, it appeared, abominably worried, he was to live consciously rueful,
      he was to live perhaps even what a scoffing world would call abjectly
      exposed; but at least he was to live saved. In spite of his clutch of
      which steadying truth, however, and in spite of his declaring to her, with
      many other angry protests and pleas, that the line of conduct she
      announced was worthy of a vindictive barmaid, a lurking fear in him, too
      deep to counsel mere defiance, made him appear to keep open a little, till
      he could somehow turn round again, the door of possible composition. He
      had scoffed at her claim, at her threat, at her thinking she could hustle
      and bully him&mdash;&ldquo;Such a way, my eye, to call back to life a dead
      love!&rdquo;&mdash;yet his instinct was ever, prudentially but helplessly, for
      gaining time, even if time only more wofully to quake, and he gained it
      now by not absolutely giving for his ultimatum that he wouldn&rsquo;t think of
      coming round. He didn&rsquo;t in the smallest degree mean to come round, but it
      was characteristic of him that he could for three or four days breathe a
      little easier by having left her under the impression that he perhaps
      might. At the same time he couldn&rsquo;t not have said&mdash;what had conduced
      to bring out, in retort, her own last word, the word on which they had
      parted&mdash;&ldquo;Do you mean to say you yourself would now be <i>willing</i>
      to marry and live with a man of whom you could feel, the thing done, that
      he&rsquo;d be all the while thinking of you in the light of a hideous coercion?&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Never you mind about <i>my</i> willingness,&rdquo; Kate had answered; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
      known what that has been for the last six months. Leave that to me, my
      willingness&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take care of it all right; and just see what
      conclusion you can come to about your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was to remember afterward how he had wondered whether, turned upon her
      in silence while her odious lucidity reigned unchecked, his face had shown
      her anything like the quantity of hate he felt. Probably not at all; no
      man&rsquo;s face <i>could</i> express that immense amount; especially the fair,
      refined, intellectual, gentlemanlike face which had had&mdash;and by her
      own more than once repeated avowal&mdash;so much to do with the enormous
      fancy she had originally taken to him. &ldquo;Which&mdash;frankly now&mdash;would
      you personally <i>rather</i> I should do,&rdquo; he had at any rate asked her
      with an intention of supreme irony: &ldquo;just sordidly marry you on top of
      this, or leave you the pleasure of your lovely appearance in court and of
      your so assured (since that&rsquo;s how you feel it) big haul of damages?
      Sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you be awfully disappointed, in fact, if I don&rsquo;t let you get
      something better out of me than a poor plain ten-shilling gold ring and
      the rest of the blasphemous rubbish, as we should make it between us,
      pronounced at the altar? I take it of course,&rdquo; he had swaggered on, &ldquo;that
      your pretension wouldn&rsquo;t be for a moment that I should&mdash;after the act
      of profanity&mdash;take up my life with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as much my dream as it ever was, Herbert Dodd, to take up mine
      with <i>you!</i> Remember for me that I can do with it, my dear, that my
      idea is for even as much as that of you!&rdquo; she had cried; &ldquo;remember that
      for me, Herbert Dodd; remember, remember!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was on this she had left him&mdash;left him frankly under a mortal
      chill. There might have been the last ring of an appeal or a show of
      persistent and perverse tenderness in it, however preposterous any such
      matter; but in point of fact her large, clean, plain, brown face&mdash;so
      much too big for her head, he now more than ever felt it to be, just as
      her head was so much too big for her body, and just as her hats had an
      irritating way of appearing to decline choice and conformity in respect to
      <i>any</i> of her dimensions&mdash;presented itself with about as much
      expression as his own shop-window when the broad, blank, sallow blind was
      down. He was fond of his shop-window with some good show on; he had a
      fancy for a good show and was master of twenty different schemes of taking
      arrangement for the old books and prints, &ldquo;high-class rarities&rdquo; his modest
      catalogue called them, in which he dealt and which his maternal uncle,
      David Geddes, had, as he liked to say, &ldquo;handed down&rdquo; to him. His widowed
      mother had screwed the whole thing, the stock and the connection and the
      rather bad little house in the rather bad little street, out of the
      ancient worthy, shortly before his death, in the name of the youngest and
      most interesting, the &ldquo;delicate&rdquo; one and the literary, of her five
      scattered and struggling children. He could enjoy his happiest
      collocations and contrasts and effects, his harmonies and varieties of
      toned and faded leather and cloth, his sought color-notes and the high
      clearnesses, here and there, of his white and beautifully figured
      price-labels, which pleased him enough in themselves almost to console him
      for not oftener having to break, on a customer&rsquo;s insistence, into the
      balanced composition. But the dropped expanse of time-soiled canvas, the
      thing of Sundays and holidays, with just his name, &ldquo;Herbert Dodd,
      Successor,&rdquo; painted on below his uncle&rsquo;s antique style, the feeble penlike
      flourishes already quite archaic&mdash;this ugly vacant mask, which might
      so easily be taken for the mask of failure, somehow always gave him a
      chill.
    </p>
    <p>
      That had been just the sort of chill&mdash;the analogy was complete&mdash;of
      Kate Cookham&rsquo;s last look. He supposed people doing an awfully good and
      sure and steady business, in whatever line, could see a whole front turned
      to vacancy that way and merely think of the hours off represented by it.
      Only for this&mdash;nervously to bear it, in other words, and Herbert
      Dodd, quite with the literary temperament himself, was capable of that
      amount of play of fancy, or even of morbid analysis&mdash;you had to be on
      some footing, you had to feel some confidence, pretty different from his
      own up to now. He had never <i>not</i> enjoyed passing his show on the
      other side of the street and taking it in thence with a casual obliquity;
      but he had never held optical commerce with the drawn blind for a moment
      longer than he could help. It <i>always</i> looked horribly final and as
      if it never would come up again. Big and bare, with his name staring at
      him from the middle, it thus offered in its grimness a turn of comparison
      for Miss Cookham&rsquo;s ominous visage. She never wore pretty, dotty,
      transparent veils, as Nan Drury did, and the words &ldquo;Herbert Dodd&rdquo;&mdash;save
      that she had sounded them at him there two or three times more like a Meg
      Merrilies or the bold bad woman in one of the melodramas of high life
      given during the fine season in the pavilion at the end of Properley Pier&mdash;were
      dreadfully, were permanently, seated on her lips. <i>She</i> was grim, no
      mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, alone in the back room above the shop, he saw so little what
      he could do that, consciously demoralised for the hour, he gave way to
      tears about it. Her taking a stand so incredibly &ldquo;low,&rdquo; that was what he
      couldn&rsquo;t get over. The particular bitterness of his cup was his having let
      himself in for a struggle on such terms&mdash;the use, on her side, of the
      vulgarest process known to the law: the vulgarest, the vulgarest, he kept
      repeating that, clinging to the help rendered him by this imputation to
      his terrorist of the vice he sincerely believed he had ever, among
      difficulties (for oh he recognised the difficulties!) sought to keep most
      alien to him. He knew what he was, in a dismal, down-trodden sphere enough&mdash;the
      lean young proprietor of an old business that had itself rather shrivelled
      with age than ever grown fat, the purchase and sale of second-hand books
      and prints, with the back street of a long-fronted south-coast
      watering-place (Old Town by good luck) for the dusky field of his life.
      But he had gone in for all the education he could get&mdash;his educated
      customers would often hang about for more talk by the half-hour at a time,
      he actually feeling himself, and almost with a scruple, hold them there;
      which meant that he had had (he couldn&rsquo;t be blind to that) natural taste
      and had lovingly cultivated and formed it. Thus, from as far back as he
      could remember, there had been things all round him that he suffered from
      when other people didn&rsquo;t; and he had kept most of his suffering to himself&mdash;which
      had taught him, in a manner, <i>how</i> to suffer, and how almost to like
      to.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, at any rate, he had never let go his sense of certain differences, he
      had done everything he could to keep it up&mdash;whereby everything that
      was vulgar was on the wrong side of his line. He had believed, for a
      series of strange, oppressed months, that Kate Cookham&rsquo;s manners and tone
      were on the right side; she had been governess&mdash;for young children&mdash;in
      two very good private families, and now had classes in literature and
      history for bigger girls who were sometimes brought by their mammas; in
      fact, coming in one day to look over his collection of students&rsquo; manuals,
      and drawing it out, as so many did, for the evident sake of his
      conversation, she had appealed to him that very first time by her
      apparently pronounced intellectual side&mdash;goodness knew she didn&rsquo;t
      even then by the physical!&mdash;which she had artfully kept in view till
      she had entangled him past undoing. And it had all been but the cheapest
      of traps&mdash;when he came to take the pieces apart a bit&mdash;laid over
      a brazen avidity. What he now collapsed for, none the less&mdash;what he
      sank down on a chair at a table and nursed his weak, scared sobs in his
      resting arms for&mdash;was the fact that, whatever the trap, it held him
      as with the grip of sharp murderous steel. There he was, there he was;
      alone in the brown summer dusk&mdash;brown through <i>his</i> windows&mdash;he
      cried and he cried. He shouldn&rsquo;t get out without losing a limb. The only
      question was which of his limbs it should be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he went out, later on&mdash;for he at last felt the need to&mdash;he
      could, however, but seek to remove from his face and his betraying eyes,
      over his washing-stand, the traces of his want of fortitude. He brushed
      himself up; with which, catching his stricken image a bit spectrally in an
      old dim toilet-glass, he knew again, in a flash, the glow of righteous
      resentment. Who should be assured against coarse usage if a man of his
      really elegant, perhaps in fact a trifle over-refined or &ldquo;effete&rdquo;
       appearance, his absolutely gentlemanlike type, couldn&rsquo;t be? He never went
      so far as to rate himself, with exaggeration, a gentleman; but he would
      have maintained against all comers, with perfect candour and as claiming a
      high advantage, that he was, in spite of that liability to blubber, &ldquo;like&rdquo;
       one; which he <i>was</i> no doubt, for that matter, at several points.
      Like what lady then, who could ever possibly have been taken for one, was
      Kate Cookham, and therefore how could one have anything&mdash;anything of
      the intimate and private order&mdash;out with her fairly and on the plane,
      the only possible one, of common equality? He might find himself crippled
      for life; he believed verily, the more he thought, that that was what was
      before him. But be ended by seeing this doom in the almost redeeming light
      of the fact that it would all have been because he was, comparatively, too
      aristocratic. Yes, a man in his station couldn&rsquo;t afford to carry that so
      far&mdash;it must sooner or later, in one way or another, spell ruin.
      Never mind&mdash;it was the only thing he could be. Of course he should
      exquisitely suffer&mdash;but when hadn&rsquo;t he exquisitely suffered? How was
      he going to get through life by <i>any</i> arrangement without that? No
      wonder such a woman as Kate Cookham had been keen to annex so rare a
      value. The right thing would have been that the highest price should be
      paid for it&mdash;by such a different sort of logic from this nightmare of
      <i>his</i> having to pay.

      Which was the way, of course, he talked to Nan Drury&mdash;as he had felt
      the immediate wild need to do; for he should perhaps be able to bear it
      all somehow or other with <i>her</i>&mdash;while they sat together, when
      time and freedom served, on one of the very last, the far westward,
      benches of the interminable sea-front. It wasn&rsquo;t every one who walked so
      far, especially at that flat season&mdash;the only ghost of a bustle now,
      save for the gregarious, the obstreperous haunters of the fluttering,
      far-shining Pier, being reserved for the sunny Parade of midwinter. It
      wasn&rsquo;t every one who cared for the sunsets (which you got awfully well
      from there and which were a particular strong point of the lower, the more
      &ldquo;sympathetic,&rdquo; as Herbert Dodd liked to call it, Properley horizon) as he
      had always intensely cared, and as he had found Nan Drury care; to say
      nothing of his having also observed how little they directly spoke to Miss
      Cookham. He had taught this oppressive companion to notice them a bit, as
      he had taught her plenty of other things, but that was a different matter;
      for the reason that the &ldquo;land&rsquo;s end&rdquo; (stretching a point it carried off
      that name) had been, and had had to be, by their lack of more sequestered
      resorts and conveniences, the scene of so much of what she styled their
      wooing-time&mdash;or, to put it more properly, of the time during which
      she had made the straightest and most unabashed love to <i>him</i>: just
      as it could henceforth but render possible, under an equal rigour, that he
      should enjoy there periods of consolation from beautiful, gentle,
      tender-souled Nan, to whom he was now at last, after the wonderful way
      they had helped each other to behave, going to make love, absolutely
      unreserved and abandoned, absolutely reckless and romantic love, a refuge
      from poisonous reality, as hard as ever he might.
    </p>
    <p>
      The league-long, paved, lighted, garden-plotted, seated and refuged Marina
      renounced its more or less celebrated attractions to break off short here;
      and an inward curve of the kindly westward shore almost made a wide-armed
      bay, with all the ugliness between town and country, and the further
      casual fringe of the coast, turning, as the day waned, to rich afternoon
      blooms of grey and brown and distant&mdash;it might fairly have been
      beautiful Hampshire&mdash;blue. Here it was that, all that blighted
      summer, with Nan&mdash;from the dreadful May-day on&mdash;he gave himself
      up to the reaction of intimacy with the <i>kind</i> of woman, at least,
      that he liked; even if of everything else that might make life possible he
      was to be, by what he could make out, forever starved. Here it was that&mdash;as
      well as on whatever other scraps of occasions they could manage&mdash;Nan
      began to take off and fold up and put away in her pocket her pretty,
      dotty, becoming veil; as under the logic of his having so tremendously
      ceased, in the shake of his dark storm-gust, to be engaged to another
      woman. Her removal of that obstacle to a trusted friend&rsquo;s assuring himself
      whether the peachlike bloom&rsquo; of her finer facial curves bore the test of
      such further inquiry into their cool sweetness as might reinforce a mere
      baffled gaze&mdash;her momentous, complete surrender of so much of her
      charm, let us say, both marked the change in the situation of the pair and
      established the record of their perfect observance of every propriety for
      so long before. They afterward in fact could have dated it, their full
      clutch of their freedom and the bliss of their having so little henceforth
      to consider save their impotence, their poverty, their ruin; dated it from
      the hour of his recital to her of the&mdash;at the first blush&mdash;quite
      appalling upshot of his second and conclusive &ldquo;scene of violence&rdquo; with the
      mistress of his fortune, when the dire terms of his release had had to be
      formally, and oh! so abjectly, acceded to. She &ldquo;compromised,&rdquo; the cruel
      brute, for Four Hundred Pounds down&mdash;for not a farthing less would
      she stay her strength from &ldquo;proceedings.&rdquo; No jury in the land but would
      give her six, on the nail (&ldquo;Oh she knew quite where she was, thank you!&rdquo;)
      and he might feel lucky to get off with so whole a skin. This was the sum,
      then, for which he had grovellingly compounded&mdash;under an agreement
      sealed by a supreme exchange of remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Where in the name of lifelong ruin are you to <i>find</i> Four
      Hundred?&rsquo;&rdquo; Miss Cookham had mockingly repeated after him while he gasped
      as from the twist of her grip on his collar. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>your</i> look-out,
      and I should have thought you&rsquo;d have made sure you knew before you decided
      on your base perfidy.&rdquo; And then she had mouthed and minced, with ever so
      false a gentility, her consistent, her sickening conclusion. &ldquo;Of course&mdash;I
      may mention again&mdash;if you too distinctly object to the trouble of
      looking, you know where to find <i>me</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had rather starve to death than ever go within a mile of you!&rdquo; Herbert
      described himself as having sweetly answered; and that was accordingly
      where <i>they</i> devotedly but desperately were&mdash;he and she,
      penniless Nan Drury. Her father, of Drury &amp; Dean, was, like so far too
      many other of the anxious characters who peered through the dull
      window-glass of dusty offices at Properley, an Estate and House Agent,
      Surveyor, Valuer and Auctioneer; she was the prettiest of six, with two
      brothers, neither of the least use, but, thanks to the manner in which
      their main natural protector appeared to languish under the accumulation
      of his attributes, they couldn&rsquo;t be said very particularly or positively
      to live. Their continued collective existence was a good deal of a miracle
      even to themselves, though they had fallen into the way of not
      unnecessarily, or too nervously, exchanging remarks upon it, and had even
      in a sort, from year to year, got used to it. Nan&rsquo;s brooding pinkness when
      he talked to her, her so very parted lips, considering her pretty teeth,
      her so very parted eyelids, considering her pretty eyes, all of which
      might have been those of some waxen image of uncritical faith, cooled the
      heat of his helplessness very much as if he were laying his head on a
      tense silk pillow. She had, it was true, forms of speech, familiar
      watchwords, that affected him as small scratchy perforations of the smooth
      surface from within; but his pleasure in her and need of her were
      independent of such things and really almost altogether determined by the
      fact of the happy, even if all so lonely, forms and instincts in her which
      claimed kinship with his own. With her natural elegance stamped on her as
      by a die, with her dim and disinherited individual refinement of grace,
      which would have made any one wonder who she was anywhere&mdash;hat and
      veil and feather-boa and smart umbrella-knob and all&mdash;with her
      regular God-given distinction of type, in fine, she couldn&rsquo;t abide
      vulgarity much more than he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore it didn&rsquo;t seem to him, under his stress, to matter particularly,
      for instance, if she <i>would</i> keep on referring so many things to the
      time, as she called it, when she came into his life&mdash;his own great
      insistence and contention being that she hadn&rsquo;t in the least entered there
      till his mind was wholly made up to eliminate his other friend. What that
      methodical fury was so fierce to bring home to him was the falsity to
      herself involved in the later acquaintance; whereas just his precious
      right to hold up his head to everything&mdash;before himself at least&mdash;sprang
      from the fact that she couldn&rsquo;t make dates fit anyhow. He hadn&rsquo;t so much
      as heard of his true beauty&rsquo;s existence (she had come back but a few weeks
      before from her two years with her terribly trying deceased aunt at
      Swindon, previous to which absence she had been an unnoticeable chit) till
      days and days, ever so many, upon his honour, after he had struck for
      freedom by his great first backing-out letter&mdash;the precious document,
      the treat for a British jury, in which, by itself, Miss Cookham&rsquo;s firm
      instructed her to recognise the prospect of a fortune. The way the
      ruffians had been &ldquo;her&rdquo; ruffians&mdash;it appeared as if she had posted
      them behind her from the first of her beginning her game!&mdash;and the
      way &ldquo;instructions&rdquo; bounced out, with it, at a touch, larger than life, as
      if she had arrived with her pocket full of them! The date of the letter,
      taken with its other connections, and the date of <i>her</i> first
      give-away for himself, his seeing her get out of the Brighton train with
      Bill Frankle that day he had gone to make the row at the Station parcels&rsquo; 
      office about the miscarriage of the box from Wales&mdash;those were the
      facts it sufficed him to point to, as he had pointed to them for Nan
      Drury&rsquo;s benefit, goodness knew, often and often enough. If he didn&rsquo;t seek
      occasion to do so for any one else&rsquo;s&mdash;in open court as they said&mdash;that
      was his own affair, or at least his and Nan&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      It little mattered, meanwhile, if on their bench of desolation, all that
      summer&mdash;and it may be added for summers and summers, to say nothing
      of winters, there and elsewhere, to come&mdash;she did give way to her
      artless habit of not contradicting him enough, which led to her often
      trailing up and down before him, too complacently, the untimely shreds and
      patches of his own glooms and desperations. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad I <i>am</i> in
      your life, terrible as it is, however or whenever I did come in!&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>Of
      course</i> you&rsquo;d rather have starved&mdash;and it seems pretty well as if
      we shall, doesn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;than have bought her off by a false, abhorrent
      love, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; and &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t as if she hadn&rsquo;t made up to you the way
      she did before you had so much as looked at her, is it? or as if you
      hadn&rsquo;t shown her what you felt her really to be before you had so much as
      looked at <i>me</i>, is it either?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Yes, how on earth, pawning the
      shoes on your feet, you&rsquo;re going to raise another shilling&mdash;<i>that&rsquo;s</i>
      what you want to know, poor darling, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;

      His creditor, at the hour it suited her, transferred her base of
      operations to town, to which impenetrable scene she had also herself
      retired; and his raising of the first Two Hundred, during five exasperated
      and miserable months, and then of another Seventy piecemeal, bleedingly,
      after long delays and under the epistolary whiplash cracked by the London
      solicitor in his wretched ear even to an effect of the very report of Miss
      Cookham&rsquo;s tongue&mdash;these melancholy efforts formed a scramble up an
      arduous steep where steps were planted and missed, and bared knees were
      excoriated, and clutches at wayside tufts succeeded and failed, on a
      system to which poor Nan could have intelligently entered only if she had
      been somehow less ladylike. She kept putting into his mouth the sick
      quaver of where he should find the rest, the always inextinguishable rest,
      long after he had in silent rage fallen away from any further payment at
      all&mdash;at first, he had but too blackly felt, for himself, to the still

      hook and by crook succeeded in being able to unload to the tune of
      Two-Hundred-and-Seventy, and then simply returned the newest reminder of
      his outstanding obligation unopened, this latter belated but real sign of
      fight, the first he had risked, remarkably caused nothing at all to
      happen; nothing at least but his being moved to quite tragically rueful
      wonder as to whether exactly some such demonstration mightn&rsquo;t have served
      his turn at an earlier stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could by this time at any rate measure his ruin&mdash;with three
      fantastic mortgages on his house, his shop, his stock, and a burden of
      interest to carry under which his business simply stretched itself
      inanimate, without strength for a protesting kick, without breath for an
      appealing groan. Customers lingering for further enjoyment of the tasteful
      remarks he had cultivated the unobstrusive art of throwing in, would at
      this crisis have found plenty to repay them, might his wit have strayed a
      little more widely still, toward a circuitous egotistical outbreak, from
      the immediate question of the merits of this and that author or of the
      condition of this and that volume. He had come to be conscious through it
      all of strangely glaring at people when they tried to haggle&mdash;and
      not, as formerly, with the glare of derisive comment on their overdone
      humour, but with that of fairly idiotised surrender&mdash;as if they were
      much mistaken in supposing, for the sake of conversation, that he might
      take himself for saveable by the difference between sevenpence and
      ninepence. He watched everything impossible and deplorable happen as in an
      endless prolongation of his nightmare; watched himself proceed, that is,
      with the finest, richest incoherence, to the due preparation of his
      catastrophe. Everything came to seem <i>equally</i> part of this&mdash;in
      complete defiance of proportion; even his final command of detachment, on
      the bench of desolation (where each successive fact of his dire case
      regularly cut itself out black, yet of senseless silhouette, against the
      red west) in respect to poor Nan&rsquo;s flat infelicities, which for the most
      part kept no pace with the years or with change, but only shook like hard
      peas in a child&rsquo;s rattle, the same peas a ways, of course, so long as the
      rattle didn&rsquo;t split open with usage or from somebody&rsquo;s act of irritation.
      They represented, or they had long done so, her contribution to the more
      superficial of the two branches of intimacy&mdash;the intellectual
      alternative, the one that didn&rsquo;t merely consist of her preparing herself
      for his putting his arm round her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were to have been moments, nevertheless, all the first couple of
      years, when she did touch in him, though to his actively dissimulating it,
      a more or less sensitive nerve&mdash;moments as they were too, to do her
      justice, when she treated him not to his own wisdom, or even folly, served
      up cold, but to a certain small bitter fruit of her personal, her
      unnatural, plucking. &ldquo;I wonder that since <i>she</i> took legal advice so
      freely, to come down on you, you didn&rsquo;t take it yourself, a little, before
      being so sure you stood no chance. Perhaps <i>your</i> people would have
      been sure of something quite different&mdash;<i>perhaps</i>, I only say,
      you know.&rdquo; She &ldquo;only&rdquo; said it, but she said it, none the less, in the
      early time, about once a fortnight. In the later, and especially after
      their marriage, it had a way of coming up again to the exclusion, as it
      seemed to him, of almost everything else; in fact during the most dismal
      years, the three of the loss of their two children, the long stretch of
      sordid embarrassment ending in her death, he was afterward to think of her
      as having generally said it several times a day. He was then also to
      remember that his answer, before she had learnt to discount it, had been
      inveterately at hand: &ldquo;What would any solicitor have done or wanted to do
      but drag me just into the hideous public arena&rdquo;&mdash;he had always so put
      it&mdash;&ldquo;that it has been at any rate my pride and my honour, the one rag
      of self-respect covering my nakedness, to have loathed and avoided from
      every point of view?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That had disposed of it so long as he cared, and by the time he had ceased
      to care for anything it had also lost itself in the rest of the vain
      babble of home. After his wife&rsquo;s death, during his year of mortal
      solitude, it awoke again as an echo of far-off things&mdash;far-off, very
      far-off, because he felt then not ten but twenty years older. That was by
      reason simply of the dead weight with which his load of debt had settled&mdash;the
      persistence of his misery dragging itself out. With all that had come and
      gone the bench of desolation was still there, just as the immortal flush
      of the westward sky kept hanging its indestructible curtain. He had never
      got away&mdash;everything had left him, but he himself had been able to
      turn his back on nothing&mdash;and now, his day&rsquo;s labour before a dirty
      desk at the Gas Works ended, he more often than not, almost any season at
      temperate Properley serving his turn, took his slow straight way to the
      Land&rsquo;s End and, collapsing there to rest, sat often for an hour at a time
      staring before him. He might in these sessions, with his eyes on the
      grey-green sea, have been counting again and still recounting the beads,
      almost all worn smooth, of his rosary of pain&mdash;which had for the
      fingers of memory and the recurrences of wonder the same felt break of the
      smaller ones by the larger that would have aided a pious mumble in some
      dusky altar-chapel.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it has been said of him that when once full submersion, as from far
      back, had visibly begun to await him, he watched himself, in a cold
      lucidity, <i>do</i> punctually and necessarily each of the deplorable
      things that were inconsistent with his keeping afloat, so at present again
      he might have been held agaze just by the presented grotesqueness of that
      vigil. Such ghosts of dead seasons were all he <i>had</i> now to watch&mdash;such
      a recaptured sense for instance as that of the dismal unavailing awareness
      that had attended his act of marriage. He had let submersion final and
      absolute become the signal for it&mdash;a mere minor determinant having
      been the more or less contemporaneously unfavourable effect on the
      business of Drury &amp; Dean of the sudden disappearance of Mr. Dean with
      the single small tin box into which the certificates of the firm&rsquo;s credit
      had been found to be compressible. That had been his only form&mdash;or
      had at any rate seemed his only one. He couldn&rsquo;t not have married, no
      doubt, just as he couldn&rsquo;t not have suffered the last degree of
      humiliation and almost of want, or just as his wife and children couldn&rsquo;t
      not have died of the little he was able, under dire reiterated pinches, to
      do for them; but it was &ldquo;rum,&rdquo; for final solitary brooding, that he hadn&rsquo;t
      appeared to see his way definitely to undertake the support of a family
      till the last scrap of his little low-browed, high-toned business, and the
      last figment of &ldquo;property&rdquo; in the old tiled and timbered shell that housed
      it, had been sacrificed to creditors mustering six rows deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course what had counted too in the odd order was that even at the end
      of the two or three years he had &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; her, Kate Cookham, gorged with
      his unholy tribute, had become the subject of no successful siege on the
      part either of Bill Frankle or, by what he could make out, of any one
      else. She had judged decent&mdash;he could do her that justice&mdash;to
      take herself personally out of his world, as he called it, for good and
      all, as soon as he had begun regularly to bleed; and, to whatever
      lucrative practice she might be devoting her great talents in London or
      elsewhere, he felt his conscious curiosity about her as cold, with time,
      as the passion of vain protest that she had originally left him to. He
      could recall but two direct echoes of her in all the bitter years&mdash;both
      communicated by Bill Frankle, disappointed and exposed and at last quite
      remarkably ingenuous sneak, who had also, from far back, taken to roaming
      the world, but who, during a period, used fitfully and ruefully to
      reappear. Herbert Dodd had quickly seen, at their first meeting&mdash;every
      one met every one sooner or later at Properley, if meeting it could always
      be called, either in the glare or the gloom of the explodedly attractive
      Embankment&mdash;that no silver stream of which he himself had been the
      remoter source could have played over the career of this all but
      repudiated acquaintance. That hadn&rsquo;t fitted with his first, his quite
      primitive raw vision of the probabilities, and he had further been puzzled
      when, much later on, it had come to him in a roundabout way that Miss
      Cookham was supposed to be, or to have been, among them for a few days &ldquo;on
      the quiet,&rdquo; and that Frankle, who had seen her and who claimed to know
      more about it than he said, was cited as authority for the fact. But he
      hadn&rsquo;t himself at this juncture seen Frankle; he had only wondered, and a
      degree of mystification had even remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      That memory referred itself to the dark days of old Drury&rsquo;s smash, the few
      weeks between his partner&rsquo;s dastardly flight and Herbert&rsquo;s own comment on
      it in the form of his standing up with Nan for the nuptial benediction of
      the Vicar of St. Bernard&rsquo;s on a very cold, bleak December morning and amid
      a circle of seven or eight long-faced, red-nosed and altogether dowdy
      persons. Poor Nan herself had come to affect him as scarce other than
      red-nosed and dowdy by that time, but this only added, in his then, and
      indeed in his lasting view, to his general and his particular morbid
      bravery. He had cultivated ignorance, there were small inward immaterial
      luxuries he could scrap-pily cherish even among other, and the harshest,
      destitutions; and one of them was represented by this easy refusal of his
      mind to render to certain passages of his experience, to various ugly
      images, names, associations, the homage of continued attention. That
      served him, that helped him; but what happened when, a dozen dismal years
      having worn themselves away, he sat single and scraped bare again, as if
      his long wave of misfortune had washed him far beyond everything and then
      conspicuously retreated, was that, thus stranded by tidal action,
      deposited in the lonely hollow of his fate, he felt even sustaining pride
      turn to nought and heard no challenge from it when old mystifications,
      stealing forth in the dusk of the day&rsquo;s work done, scratched at the door
      of speculation and hung about, through the idle hours, for irritated
      notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evenings of his squalid clerkship were all leisure now, but there was
      nothing at all near home on the other hand, for his imagination, numb and
      stiff from its long chill, to begin to play with. Voices from far off
      would quaver to him therefore in the stillness; where he knew for the most
      recurrent, little by little, the faint wail of his wife. He had become
      deaf to it in life, but at present, after so great an interval, he
      listened again, listened and listened, and seemed to hear it sound as by
      the pressure of some weak broken spring. It phrased for his ear her
      perpetual question, the one she had come to at the last as under the
      obsession of a discovered and resented wrong, a wrong withal that had its
      source much more in his own action than anywhere else. &ldquo;That you didn&rsquo;t
      make <i>sure</i> she could have done anything, that you didn&rsquo;t make sure
      and that you were too afraid!&rdquo;&mdash;this commemoration had ended by
      playing such a part of Nan&rsquo;s finally quite contracted consciousness as to
      exclude everything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time, somehow, he had made his terms with it; he had then more
      urgent questions to meet than that of the poor creature&rsquo;s taste in
      worrying pain; but actually it struck him&mdash;not the question, but the
      fact itself of the taste&mdash;as the one thing left over from all that
      had come and gone. So it was; nothing remained to him in the world, on the
      bench of desolation, but the option of taking up that echo&mdash;together
      with an abundance of free time for doing so. That he hadn&rsquo;t made sure of
      what might and what mightn&rsquo;t have been done to him, that he had been too
      afraid&mdash;had the proposition a possible bearing on his present
      apprehension of things? To reply indeed he would have had to be able to
      say what his present apprehension of things, left to itself, amounted to;
      an uninspiring effort indeed he judged it, sunk to so poor a pitch was his
      material of thought&mdash;though it might at last have been the feat he
      sought to perform as he stared at the grey-green sea.

      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was seldom he was disturbed in any form of sequestered speculation, or
      that at his times of predilection, especially that of the long autumn
      blankness between the season of trippers and the season of Bath-chairs,
      there were westward stragglers enough to jar upon his settled sense of
      priority. For himself his seat, the term of his walk, was consecrated; it
      had figured to him for years as the last (though there were others, not
      immediately near it, and differently disposed, that might have aspired to
      the title); so that he could invidiously distinguish as he approached,
      make out from a distance any accident of occupation, and never draw nearer
      while that unpleasantness lasted. What he disliked was to compromise on
      his tradition, whether for a man, a woman or a connoodling couple; it was
      to idiots of this last composition he most objected, he having sat there,
      in the past, alone, having sat there interminably with Nan, having sat
      there with&mdash;well, with other women when women, at hours of ease,
      could still care or count for him, but having never shared the place with
      any shuffling or snuffling stranger. It was a world of fidgets and starts,
      however, the world of his present dreariness&mdash;he alone possessed in
      it, he seemed to make out, of the secret, of the dignity of sitting still
      with one&rsquo;s fate; so that if he took a turn about or rested briefly
      elsewhere even foolish philanderers&mdash;though this would never have
      been his and Nan&rsquo;s way&mdash;ended soon by some adjournment as visibly
      pointless as their sprawl. Then, their backs turned, he would drop down on
      it, the bench of desolation&mdash;which was what he, and he only, made it
      by sad adoption; where, for that matter, moreover, once he had settled at
      his end, it was marked that nobody else ever came to sit. He saw people,
      along the Marina, take this liberty with other resting presences; but his
      own struck them perhaps in general as either of too grim or just of too
      dingy a vicinage. He might have affected the fellow-lounger as a man evil,
      unsociable, possibly engaged in working out the idea of a crime; or
      otherwise, more probably&mdash;for on the whole he surely looked harmless&mdash;devoted
      to the worship of some absolutely unpractical remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a certain October Saturday he had got off, as usual, early; but the
      afternoon light, his pilgrimage drawing to its aim, could still show him,
      at long range, the rare case of an established usurper. His impulse was
      then, as by custom, to deviate a little and wait, all the more that the
      occupant of the bench was a lady, and that ladies, when alone, were&mdash;at
      that austere end of the varied frontal stretch&mdash;markedly
      discontinuous; but he kept on at sight of this person&rsquo;s rising, while he
      was still fifty yards off, and proceeding, her back turned, to the edge of
      the broad terrace, the outer line of which followed the interspaced
      succession of seats and was guarded by an iron rail from the abruptly
      lower level of the beach. Here she stood before the sea, while our friend
      on his side, recognising no reason to the contrary, sank into the place
      she had quitted. There were other benches, eastward and off by the course
      of the drive, for vague ladies. The lady indeed thus thrust upon Herbert&rsquo;s
      vision might have struck an observer either as not quite vague or as vague
      with a perverse intensity suggesting design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that our own observer at once thought of these things; he only took
      in, and with no great interest, that the obtruded presence was a &ldquo;real&rdquo;
       lady; that she was dressed&mdash;he noticed such matters&mdash;with a
      certain elegance of propriety or intention of harmony; and that she
      remained perfectly still for a good many minutes; so many in fact that he
      presently ceased to heed her, and that as she wasn&rsquo;t straight before him,
      but as far to the left as was consistent with his missing her profile, he
      had turned himself to one of his sunsets again (though it wasn&rsquo;t quite one
      of his best) and let it hold him for a time that enabled her to alter her
      attitude and present a fuller view. Without other movement, but her back
      now to the sea and her face to the odd person who had appropriated her
      corner, she had taken a sustained look at him before he was aware she had
      stirred. On that apprehension, however, he became also promptly aware of
      her direct, her applied observation. As his sense of this quickly
      increased he wondered who she was and what she wanted&mdash;what, as it
      were, was the matter with her; it suggested to him, the next thing, that
      she had, under some strange idea, actually been waiting for him. Any idea
      about him to-day on the part of any one could only be strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she stood there with the ample width of the Marina between them, but
      turned to him, for all the world, as to show frankly that she was
      concerned with him. And she <i>was</i>&mdash;oh yes&mdash;a real lady: a
      middle-aged person, of good appearance and of the best condition, in quiet
      but &ldquo;handsome&rdquo; black, save for very fresh white kid gloves, and with a
      pretty, dotty, becoming veil, predominantly white, adjusted to her
      countenance; which through it somehow, even to his imperfect sight, showed
      strong fine black brows and what he would have called on the spot
      character. But she was pale; her black brows were the blacker behind the
      flattering tissue; she still kept a hand, for support, on the
      terrace-rail, while the other, at the end of an extended arm that had an
      effect of rigidity, clearly pressed hard on the knob of a small and
      shining umbrella, the lower extremity of whose stick was equally, was
      sustainingly, firm on the walk. So this mature, qualified, important
      person stood and looked at the limp, undistinguished&mdash;oh his values
      of aspect now!&mdash;shabby man on the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was extraordinary, but the fact of her interest, by immensely
      surprising, by immediately agitating him, blinded him at first to her
      identity and, for the space of his long stare, diverted him from it; with
      which even then, when recognition did break, the sense of the shock,
      striking inward, simply consumed itself in gaping stillness. He sat there
      motionless and weak, fairly faint with surprise, and there was no instant,
      in all the succession of so many, at which Kate Cookham could have caught
      the special sign of his intelligence. Yet that she did catch something he
      saw&mdash;for he saw her steady herself, by her two supported hands, to
      meet it; while, after she had done so, a very wonderful thing happened, of
      which he could scarce, later on, have made a clear statement, though he
      was to think it over again and again. She moved toward him, she reached
      him, she stood there, she sat down near him, he merely passive and
      wonderstruck, unresentfully &ldquo;impressed,&rdquo; gaping and taking it in&mdash;and
      all as with an open allowance on the part of each, so that they positively
      and quite intimately met in it, o the impertinence for their case, this
      case that brought them again, after horrible years, face to face, of the
      vanity, the profanity, the impossibility, of anything between them but
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearer to him, beside him at a considerable interval (oh she was immensely
      considerate!) she presented him, in the sharp terms of her transformed
      state&mdash;but thus the more amply, formally, ceremoniously&mdash;with
      the reasons that would serve him best for not having precipitately known
      her. She was simply another and a totally different person, and the
      exhibition of it to which she had proceeded with this solemn anxiety was
      all, obviously, for his benefit&mdash;once he had, as he appeared to be
      doing, provisionally accepted her approach. He had remembered her as
      inclined to the massive and disowned by the graceful; but this was a
      spare, fine, worn, almost wasted lady&mdash;who had repaired waste, it was
      true, however, with something he could only appreciate as a rich
      accumulation of manner. She was strangely older, so far as that went&mdash;marked
      by experience and as if many things had happened to her; her face had
      suffered, to its improvement, contraction and concentration; and if he had
      granted, of old and from the first, that her eyes were remarkable, had
      they yet ever had for him this sombre glow? Withal, something said, she
      had flourished&mdash;he felt it, wincing at it, as that; she had had a
      life, a career, a history&mdash;something that her present waiting air and
      nervous consciousness couldn&rsquo;t prevent his noting there as a deeply latent
      assurance. She had flourished, she had flourished&mdash;though to learn it
      after this fashion was somehow at the same time not to feel she flaunted
      it. It wasn&rsquo;t thus execration that she revived in him; she made in fact,
      exhibitively, as he could only have put it, the matter of long ago
      irrelevant, and these extraordinary minutes of their reconstituted
      relation&mdash;how many? how few?&mdash;addressed themselves altogether to
      new possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still it after a little awoke in him as with the throb of a touched nerve
      that his own very attitude was supplying a connection; he knew presently
      that he wouldn&rsquo;t have had her go, <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> have made a sign to her
      for it&mdash;which was what she had been uncertain of&mdash;without
      speaking to him; and that therefore he was, as at the other, the hideous
      time, passive to whatever she might do. She was even yet, she was always,
      in possession of him; she had known how and where to find him and had
      appointed that he should see her, and, though he had never dreamed it was
      again to happen to him, he was meeting it already as if it might have been
      the only thing that the least humanly <i>could</i>. Yes, he had come back
      there to flop, by long custom, upon the bench of desolation <i>as</i> the
      man in the whole place, precisely, to whom nothing worth more than
      tuppence could happen; whereupon, in the grey desert of his consciousness,
      the very earth had suddenly opened and flamed. With this, further, it came
      over him that he hadn&rsquo;t been prepared and that his wretched appearance
      must show it. He wasn&rsquo;t fit to receive a visit&mdash;any visit; a flush
      for his felt misery, in the light of her opulence, broke out in his lean
      cheeks. But if he coloured he sat as he was&mdash;she should at least, as
      a visitor, be satisfied. His eyes only, at last, turned from her and
      resumed a little their gaze at the sea. That, however, didn&rsquo;t relieve him,
      and he perpetrated in the course of another moment the odd desperate
      gesture of raising both his hands to his face and letting them, while he
      pressed it to them, cover and guard it. It was as he held them there that
      she at last spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go away if you wish me to.&rdquo; And then she waited a moment. &ldquo;I mean
      now&mdash;now that you&rsquo;ve seen I&rsquo;m here. I wanted you to know it, and I
      thought of writing&mdash;I was afraid of our meeting accidentally. Then I
      was afraid that if I wrote you might refuse. So I thought of this way&mdash;as
      I knew you must come out here.&rdquo; She went on with pauses, giving him a
      chance to make a sign. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve waited several days. But I&rsquo;ll do what you
      wish. Only I should like in that case to come back.&rdquo; Again she stopped;
      but strange was it to him that he wouldn&rsquo;t have made her break off. She
      held him in boundless wonder. &ldquo;I came down&mdash;I mean I came from town&mdash;on
      purpose. I&rsquo;m staying on still, and I&rsquo;ve a great patience and will give you
      time. Only may I say it&rsquo;s important? Now that I do see you,&rdquo; she brought
      out in the same way, &ldquo;I see how inevitable it was&mdash;I mean that I
      should have wanted to come. But you must feel about it as you can,&rdquo; she
      wound up&mdash;&ldquo;till you get used to the idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke so for accommodation, for discretion, for some ulterior view
      already expressed in her manner, that, after taking well in, from behind
      his hands, that this was her very voice&mdash;oh ladylike!&mdash;heard,
      and heard in deprecation of displeasure, after long years again, he
      uncovered his face and freshly met her eyes. More than ever he couldn&rsquo;t
      have known her. Less and less remained of the figure all the facts of
      which had long ago so hardened for him. She was a handsome, grave,
      authoritative, but refined and, as it were, physically rearranged person&mdash;she,
      the outrageous vulgarity of whose prime assault had kept him shuddering so
      long as a shudder was in him. That atrocity in her was what everything had
      been built on, but somehow, all strangely, it was slipping from him; so
      that, after the oddest fashion conceivable, when he felt he mustn&rsquo;t let
      her go, it was as if he were putting out his hand to save the past, the
      hideous real unalterable past, exactly as she had been the cause of its
      being and the cause of his undergoing it. He should have been too awfully
      &ldquo;sold&rdquo; if he wasn&rsquo;t going to have been right about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; he heard himself at last say. Not to mind had seemed for
      the instant the length he was prepared to go; but he was afterward aware
      of how soon he must have added: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come on purpose to see me?&rdquo; He was
      on the point of putting to her further: &ldquo;What then do you want of me?&rdquo; But
      he would keep&mdash;yes, in time&mdash;from appearing to show he cared. If
      he showed he cared, where then would be his revenge? So he was already,
      within five minutes, thinking his revenge uncomfortably over instead of
      just comfortably knowing it. What came to him, at any rate, as they
      actually fell to talk, was that, with such precautions, considerations,
      reduplications of consciousness, almost avowed feelings of her way on her
      own part, and light fingerings of his chords of sensibility, she was
      understanding, she <i>had</i> understood, more things than all the years,
      up to this strange eventide, had given him an inkling of. They talked,
      they went on&mdash;he hadn&rsquo;t let her retreat, to whatever it committed him
      and however abjectly it did so; yet keeping off and off, dealing with such
      surface facts as involved ancient acquaintance but held abominations at
      bay. The recognition, the attestation that she <i>had</i> come down for
      him, that there would be reasons, that she had even hovered and watched,
      assured herself a little of his habits (which she managed to speak of as
      if, on their present ampler development, they were much to be deferred
      to), detained them enough to make vivid how, listen as stiffly or as
      serenely as he might, she sat there in fear, just as she had so stood
      there at first, and that her fear had really to do with her calculation of
      some sort of chance with him. What chance could it possibly be? Whatever
      it might have done, on this prodigious showing, with Kate Cookham, it made
      the present witness to the state of his fortunes simply exquisite: he
      ground his teeth secretly together as he saw he should have to take <i>that</i>.
      For what did it mean but that she would have liked to pity him if she
      could have done it with safety? Ah, however, he must give her no measure
      of safety!
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time he had remarked, with that idea, that she probably saw few
      changes about them there that weren&rsquo;t for the worse&mdash;the place was
      going down, down and down, so fast that goodness knew where it would stop&mdash;and
      had also mentioned that in spite of this he himself remained faithful,
      with all its faults loving it still; by the time he had, after that
      fashion, superficially indulged her, adding a few further light and just
      sufficiently dry reflections on local matters, the disappearance of
      landmarks and important persons, the frequency of gales, the low policy of
      the town-council in playing down to cheap excursionists: by the time he
      had so acquitted himself, and she had observed, of her own motion, that
      she was staying at the Royal, which he knew for the time-honoured, the
      conservative and exclusive hotel, he had made out for himself one thing at
      least, the amazing fact that he had been landed by his troubles, at the
      end of time, in a &ldquo;social relation,&rdquo; of all things in the world, and how
      of that luxury he was now having unprecedented experience. He had but once
      in his life had his nose in the Royal, on the occasion of his himself
      delivering a parcel during some hiatus in his succession of impossible
      small boys and meeting in the hall the lady who had bought of him, in the
      morning, a set of Crabbe, largely, he flattered himself, under the artful
      persuasion of his acute remarks on that author, gracefully associated by
      him, in this colloquy, he remembered, with a glance at Charles Lamb as
      well, and who went off in a day or two without settling, though he
      received her cheque from London three or four months later.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>That</i> hadn&rsquo;t been a social relation; and truly, deep within his
      appeal to himself to be remarkable, to be imperturbable and impenetrable,
      to be in fact quite incomparable now, throbbed the intense vision of his
      drawing out and draining dry the sensation he had begun to taste. He would
      do it, moreover&mdash;that would be the refinement of his art&mdash;not
      only without the betraying anxiety of a single question, but just even by
      seeing her flounder (since she must, in a vagueness deeply disconcerting
      to her) as to her real effect on him. She was distinctly floundering by
      the time he had brought her&mdash;it had taken ten minutes&mdash;down to a
      consciousness of absurd and twaddling topics, to the reported precarious
      state, for instance, of the syndicate running the Bijou Theatre at the
      Pierhead&mdash;all as an admonition that she might want him to want to
      know why she was thus waiting on him, might want it for all she was worth,
      before he had ceased to be so remarkable as not to ask her. He didn&rsquo;t&mdash;and
      this assuredly was wondrous enough&mdash;want to do anything worse to her
      than let her flounder; but he was willing to do that so long as it
      mightn&rsquo;t prevent his seeing at least where <i>he</i> was. He seemed still
      to see where he was even at the minute that followed her final break-off,
      clearly intended to be resolute, from make-believe talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if I might prevail on you to come to tea with me to-morrow at
      five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He didn&rsquo;t so much as answer it&mdash;though he could scarcely believe his
      ears. To-morrow was Sunday, and the proposal referred, clearly, to the
      custom of &ldquo;five-o&rsquo;clock&rdquo; tea, known to him only by the contemporary novel
      of manners and the catchy advertisement of table-linen. He had never in
      his life been present at any such luxurious rite, but he was offering
      practical indifference to it as a false mark of his sense that his social
      relation had already risen to his chin. &ldquo;I gave up my very modest, but
      rather interesting little old book business, perhaps you know, ever so
      long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She floundered so that she could say nothing&mdash;meet <i>that</i> with
      no possible word; all the less too that his tone, casual and colourless,
      wholly defied any apprehension of it as a reverse. Silence only came; but
      after a moment she returned to her effort. &ldquo;If you <i>can</i> come I shall
      be at home. To see you otherwise than thus was in fact what, as I tell
      you, I came down for. But I leave it,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;to your feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had at this, it struck him, an inspiration; which he required however a
      minute or two to decide to carry out; a minute or two during which the
      shake of his foot over his knee became an intensity of fidget. &ldquo;Of course
      I know I still owe you a large sum of money. If it&rsquo;s about <i>that</i> you
      wish to see me,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I may as well tell you just here that I
      shall be able to meet my full obligation in the future as little as I&rsquo;ve
      met it in the past. I can never,&rdquo; said Herbert Dodd, &ldquo;pay up that
      balance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had looked at her while he spoke, but on finishing looked off at the
      sea again and continued to agitate his foot. He knew now what he had done
      and why; and the sense of her fixed dark eyes on him during his speech and
      after didn&rsquo;t alter his small contentment. Yet even when she still said
      nothing he didn&rsquo;t turn round; he simply kept his corner as if <i>that</i>
      were his point made, should it even be the last word between them. It
      might have been, for that matter, from the way in which she presently
      rose, gathering herself, her fine umbrella and her very small smart
      reticule, in the construction of which shining gilt much figured, well
      together, and, after standing another instant, moved across to the rail of
      the terrace as she had done before and remained, as before, with her back
      to him, though this time, it well might be, under a different fear. A
      quarter of an hour ago she hadn&rsquo;t tried him, and had had that anxiety; now
      that she had tried him it wasn&rsquo;t easier&mdash;but she was thinking what
      she still could do. He left her to think&mdash;nothing in fact more
      interesting than the way she might decide had ever happened to him; but it
      was a part of this also that as she turned round and came nearer again he
      didn&rsquo;t rise, he gave her no help. If she got any, at least, from his
      looking up at her only, meeting her fixed eyes once more in silence, that
      was her own affair. &ldquo;You must think,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;you must take all
      your time, but I shall be at home.&rdquo; She left it to him thus&mdash;she
      insisted, with her idea, on leaving him something too. And on her side as
      well she showed an art&mdash;which resulted, after another instant, in his
      having to rise to his feet. He flushed afresh as he did it&mdash;it
      exposed him so shabbily the more; and now if she took him in, with each of
      his seedy items, from head to foot, he didn&rsquo;t and couldn&rsquo;t and wouldn&rsquo;t
      know it, attaching his eyes hard and straight to something quite away from
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It stuck in his throat to say he&rsquo;d come, but she had so curious a way with
      her that he still less could say he wouldn&rsquo;t, and in a moment had taken
      refuge in something that was neither. &ldquo;Are you married?&rdquo;&mdash;he put it
      to her with that plainness, though it had seemed before he said it to do
      more for him than while she waited before replying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not married,&rdquo; she said; and then had another wait that might have
      amounted to a question of what this had to do with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He surely couldn&rsquo;t have told her; so that he had recourse, a little poorly
      as he felt, but to an &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; that still left them opposed. He turned away
      for it&mdash;that is for the poorness, which, lingering in the air, had
      almost a vulgar platitude; and when he presently again wheeled about she
      had fallen off as for quitting him, only with a pause, once more, for a
      last look. It was all a bit awkward, but he had another happy thought,
      which consisted in his silently raising his hat as for a sign of dignified
      dismissal. He had cultivated of old, for the occasions of life, the right,
      the discriminated bow, and now, out of the grey limbo of the time when he
      could care for such things, this flicker of propriety leaped and worked
      She might, for that matter, herself have liked it; since, receding
      further, only with her white face toward him, she paid it the homage of
      submission. He remained dignified, and she almost humbly went.

    <p>
      Nothing in the world, on the Sunday afternoon, could have prevented him
      from going; he was not after all destitute of three or four such articles
      of clothing as, if they wouldn&rsquo;t particularly grace the occasion, wouldn&rsquo;t
      positively dishonour it. That deficiency might have kept him away, but no
      voice of the spirit, no consideration of pride. It sweetened his
      impatience in fact&mdash;for he fairly felt it a long time to wait&mdash;that
      his pride would really most find its account in his acceptance of these
      conciliatory steps. From the moment he could put it in that way&mdash;that
      he couldn&rsquo;t refuse to hear what she might have, so very elaborately, to
      say for herself&mdash;he ought certainly to be at his ease; in
      illustration of which he whistled odd snatches to himself as he hung about
      on that cloud-dappled autumn Sunday, a mild private minstrelsy that his
      lips hadn&rsquo;t known since when? The interval of the twenty-four hours, made
      longer by a night of many more revivals than oblivions, had in fact
      dragged not a little; in spite of which, however, our extremely brushed-up
      and trimmed and polished friend knew an unprecedented flutter as he was
      ushered, at the Royal Hotel, into Miss Cookham&rsquo;s sitting-room. Yes, it was
      an adventure, and he had never had an adventure in his life; the term, for
      him, was essentially a term of high appreciation&mdash;such as
      disqualified for that figure, under due criticism, every single passage of
      his past career.
    </p>
    <p>
      What struck him at the moment as qualifying in the highest degree this
      actual passage was the fact that at no great distance from his hostess in
      the luxurious room, as he apprehended it, in which the close of day had
      begun to hang a few shadows, sat a gentleman who rose as she rose, and
      whose name she at once mentioned to him. He had for Herbert Dodd all the
      air of a swell, the gentleman&mdash;rather red-faced and bald-headed, but
      moustachioed, waistcoated, necktied to the highest pitch, with an effect
      of chains and rings, of shining teeth in a glassily monocular smile; a
      wondrous apparition to have been asked to &ldquo;meet&rdquo; him, as in contemporary
      fiction, or for him to have been asked to meet. &ldquo;Captain Roper, Mr.
      Herbert Dodd&rdquo;&mdash;their entertainer introduced them, yes; but with a
      sequel immediately afterward more disconcerting apparently to Captain
      Roper himself even than to her second and more breathless visitor; a &ldquo;Well
      then, good-bye till the next time,&rdquo; with a hand thrust straight out, which
      allowed the personage so addressed no alternative but to lay aside his
      teacup, even though Herbert saw there was a good deal left in it, and
      glare about him for his hat. Miss Cookham had had her tea-tray on a small
      table before her, she had served Captain Roper while waiting for Mr. Dodd;
      but she simply dismissed him now, with a high sweet unmistakable decision,
      a knowledge of what she was about, as our hero would have called it, which
      enlarged at a stroke the latter&rsquo;s view of the number of different things
      and sorts of things, in the sphere of the manners and ways of those living
      at their ease, that a social relation would put before one. Captain Roper
      would have liked to remain, would have liked more tea, but Kate signified
      in this direct fashion that she had had enough of him. Herbert had seen
      things, in his walk of life&mdash;rough things, plenty; but never things
      smoothed with that especial smoothness, carried out as it were by the fine
      form of Captain Roper&rsquo;s own retreat, which included even a bright
      convulsed leave-taking cognisance of the plain, vague individual, of no
      lustre at all and with the very low-class guard of an old silver watch
      buttoned away under an ill-made coat, to whom he was sacrificed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came to Herbert as he left the place a shade less remarkable&mdash;though
      there was still wonder enough and to spare&mdash;that he had been even
      publicly and designedly sacrificed; exactly so that, as the door closed
      behind him, Kate Cookham, standing there to wait for it, could seem to
      say, across the room, to the friend of her youth, only by the expression
      of her fine eyes: &ldquo;There&mdash;see what I do for you!&rdquo; &ldquo;For&rdquo; him&mdash;that
      was the extraordinary thing, and not less so that he was already, within
      three minutes, after this fashion, taking it in as by the intensity of a
      new light; a light that was one somehow with this rich inner air of the
      plush-draped and much-mirrored hotel, where the fire-glow and the approach
      of evening confirmed together the privacy, and the loose curtains at the
      wide window were parted for a command of his old lifelong Parade&mdash;the
      field of life so familiar to him from below and in the wind and the wet,
      but which he had never in all the long years hung over at this vantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an acquaintance, but a bore,&rdquo; his hostess explained in respect to
      Captain Roper. &ldquo;He turned up yesterday, but I didn&rsquo;t invite him, and I had
      said to him before you came in that I was expecting a gentleman with whom
      I should wish to be alone. I go quite straight at my idea that way, as a
      rule; but you know,&rdquo; she now strikingly went on, &ldquo;how straight I go. And
      he had had,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;his tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dodd had been looking all round&mdash;had taken in, with the rest, the
      brightness, the distinguished elegance, as he supposed it, of the
      tea-service with which she was dealing and the variously tinted appeal of
      certain savoury edibles on plates. &ldquo;Oh but he <i>hadn&rsquo;t</i> had his tea!&rdquo;
       he heard himself the next moment earnestly reply; which speech had at once
      betrayed, he was then quickly aware, the candour of his interest, the
      unsophisticated state that had survived so many troubles. If he was so
      interested how could he be proud, and if he was proud how could he be so
      interested?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had made her at any rate laugh outright, and was further conscious, for
      this, both that it was the first time of that since their new meeting, and
      that it didn&rsquo;t affect him as harsh. It affected him, however, as free, for
      she replied at once, still smiling and as a part of it: &ldquo;Oh, I think we
      shall get on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This told him he had made some difference for her, shown her the way, or
      something like it, that she hadn&rsquo;t been sure of yesterday; which moreover
      wasn&rsquo;t what he had intended&mdash;he had come armed for showing her
      nothing; so that after she had gone on with the same gain of gaiety, &ldquo;You
      must at any rate comfortably have yours,&rdquo; there was but one answer for him
      to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes played again over the tea-things&mdash;they seemed strangely to
      help him; but he didn&rsquo;t sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come, as you see&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve come, please, to understand; and if
      you require to be alone with me, and if I break bread with you, it seems
      to me I should first know exactly where I am and to what you suppose I so
      commit myself.&rdquo; He had thought it out and over and over, particularly the
      turn about breaking bread; though perhaps he didn&rsquo;t give it, in her
      presence&mdash;this was impossible, her presence altered so many things&mdash;quite
      the full sound or the weight he had planned.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it had none the less come to his aid&mdash;it had made her perfectly
      grave. &ldquo;You commit yourself to nothing. You&rsquo;re perfectly free. It&rsquo;s only I
      who commit myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On which, while she stood there as if all handsomely and deferentially
      waiting for him to consider and decide, he would have been naturally moved
      to ask her what she committed herself then <i>to</i>&mdash;so moved, that
      is, if he hadn&rsquo;t, before saying it, thought more sharply still of
      something better. &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s another thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s another thing,&rdquo; Kate Cookham returned. To which she added,
      &ldquo;So <i>now</i> won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo; He sank with deliberation into the
      seat from which Captain Roper had risen; she went back to her own and
      while she did so spoke again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>not</i> free. At least,&rdquo; she said
      over her tea-tray, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m free only for this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everything was there before them and around them, everything massive and
      shining, so that he had instinctively fallen back in his chair as for the
      wondering, the resigned acceptance of it; where her last words stirred in
      him a sense of odd deprecation. Only for &ldquo;that&rdquo;? &ldquo;That&rdquo; was everything, at
      this moment, to his long inanition, and the effect, as if she had suddenly
      and perversely mocked him, was to press the spring of a protest. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
      &lsquo;this&rsquo; then riches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Riches?&rdquo; she smiled over, handing him his cup&mdash;for she had triumphed
      in having struck from him a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean haven&rsquo;t you a lot of money?&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t care now that it was out;
      his cup was in his hand, and what was that but proved interest? He had
      succumbed to the social relation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve money. Of course you wonder&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve wanted you to
      wonder. It was to make you take that in that I came. So now you know,&rdquo; she
      said, leaning back where she faced him, but in a straighter chair and with
      her arms closely folded, after a fashion characteristic of her, as for
      some control of her nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You came to show you&rsquo;ve money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the things. Not a lot&mdash;not even very much. But
      enough,&rdquo; said Kate Cookham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough? I should think so!&rdquo; he again couldn&rsquo;t help a bit crudely
      exhaling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough for what I wanted. I don&rsquo;t always live like this&mdash;not at all.
      But I came to the best hotel on purpose. I wanted to show you I could.
      Now,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Understand?&rdquo; He only gaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw up her loosed arms, which dropped again beside her. &ldquo;I did it <i>for</i>
      you&mdash;I did it <i>for</i> you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;For&rsquo; me&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I did&mdash;what I did here of old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared, trying to see it. &ldquo;When you made me pay you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Two Hundred and Seventy&mdash;all I could get from you, as you
      reminded me yesterday, so that I had to give up the rest It was my idea,&rdquo;
       she went on&mdash;&ldquo;it was my idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To bleed me quite to death?&rdquo; Oh, his ice was broken now!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To make you raise money&mdash;since you could, you <i>could</i>. You did,
      you did&mdash;so what better proof?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hands fell from what he had touched; he could only stare&mdash;her own
      manner for it was different now too. &ldquo;I did. I did indeed&mdash;!&rdquo; And the
      woful weak simplicity of it, which seemed somehow all that was left him,
      fell even on his own ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, here it is&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t lost!&rdquo; she returned with a graver
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Here&rsquo; it is,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;my poor agonised old money&mdash;my blood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s <i>my</i> blood too, you must know now!&rdquo; She held up her head as
      not before&mdash;as for her right to speak of the thing to-day most
      precious to her. &ldquo;I took it, but this&mdash;my being here this way&mdash;is
      what I&rsquo;ve made of it! That was the idea I had!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her &ldquo;ideas,&rdquo; as things to boast of, staggered him. &ldquo;To have everything in
      the world, like this, at my wretched expense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had folded her arms back again&mdash;grasping each elbow she sat firm;
      she knew he could see, and had known well from the first, what she had
      wanted to say, difficult, monstrous though it might be. &ldquo;No more than at
      my own&mdash;but to do something with your money that you&rsquo;d never do
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Myself, myself?&rdquo; he wonderingly wailed. &ldquo;Do you know&mdash;or don&rsquo;t you?&mdash;what
      my life has been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waited, and for an instant, though the light in the room had failed a
      little more and would soon be mainly that of the flaring lamps on the
      windy Parade, he caught from her dark eye a silver gleam of impatience.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve suffered and you&rsquo;ve worked&mdash;which, God knows, is what I&rsquo;ve
      done! <i>Of course</i> you&rsquo;ve suffered,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;you inevitably
      had to! We have to,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;to do or to be or to get anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray what have I done or been or got?&rdquo; Herbert Dodd found it almost
      desolately natural to demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It made her cover him again as with all she was thinking of. &ldquo;Can you
      imagine nothing, or can&rsquo;t you conceive&mdash;?&rdquo; And then as her challenge
      struck deeper in, deeper down than it had yet reached, and with the effect
      of a rush of the blood to his face, &ldquo;It was <i>for</i> you, it was <i>for</i>
      you!&rdquo; she again broke out&mdash;&ldquo;and for what or whom else could it have
      been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw things to a tune now that made him answer straight: &ldquo;I thought at
      one time it might be for Bill Frankle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;that was the way you treated me,&rdquo; Miss Cookham as plainly
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he let this pass; his thought had already got away from it. &ldquo;What good
      then&mdash;its having been for me&mdash;has that ever done me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it do you any good <i>now?</i>&rdquo; his friend returned. To which she
      added, with another dim play of her tormented brightness, before he could
      speak: &ldquo;But if you won&rsquo;t even have your tea&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had in fact touched nothing and, if he could have explained, would have
      pleaded very veraciously that his appetite, keen when he came in, had
      somehow suddenly failed. It was beyond eating or drinking, what she seemed
      to want him to take from her. So if he looked, before him, over the array,
      it was to say, very grave and graceless: &ldquo;Am I to understand that you
      offer to repay me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I offer to repay you with interest, Herbert Dodd&rdquo;&mdash;and her emphasis
      of the great word was wonderful.
    </p>
    <p>
      It held him in his place a minute, and held his eyes upon her; after
      which, agitated too sharply to sit still, he pushed back his chair and
      stood up. It was as if mere distress or dismay at first worked in him, and
      was in fact a wave of deep and irresistible emotion which made him, on his
      feet, sway as in a great trouble and then, to correct it, throw himself
      stiffly toward the window, where he stood and looked out unseeing. The
      road, the wide terrace beyond, the seats, the eternal sea beyond that, the
      lighted lamps now flaring in the October night-wind, with the few
      dispersed people abroad at the tea-hour; these things, meeting and melting
      into the firelit hospitality at his elbow&mdash;or was it that portentous
      amenity that melted into <i>them?</i>&mdash;seemed to form round him and
      to put before him, all together, the strangest of circles and the newest
      of experiences, in which the unforgettable and the unimaginable were
      confoundingly mixed. &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh!&rdquo;&mdash;he could only almost howl for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, while a thick blur for some moments mantled everything, he knew
      she had got up, that she stood watching him, allowing for everything,
      again all &ldquo;cleverly&rdquo; patient with him, and he heard her speak again as
      with studied quietness and clearness. &ldquo;I wanted to take care of you&mdash;it
      was what I first wanted&mdash;and what you first consented to. I&rsquo;d have
      done it, oh I&rsquo;d have done it, I&rsquo;d have loved you and helped you and
      guarded you, and you&rsquo;d have had no trouble, no bad blighting ruin, in all
      your easy, yes, just your quite jolly and comfortable life. I showed you
      and proved to you this&mdash;I brought it home to you, as I fondly
      fancied, and it made me briefly happy. You swore you cared for me, you
      wrote it and made me believe it&mdash;you pledged me your honour and your
      faith. Then you turned and changed suddenly from one day to another;
      everything altered, you broke your vows, you as good as told me you only
      wanted it off. You faced me with dislike, and in fact tried not to face me
      at all; you behaved as if you hated me&mdash;you had seen a girl, of great
      beauty, I admit, who made me a fright and a bore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This brought him straight round. &ldquo;No, Kate Cookham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Herbert Dodd.&rdquo; She but shook her head, calmly and nobly, in the now
      gathered dusk, and her memories and her cause and her character&mdash;or
      was it only her arch-subtlety, her line and her &ldquo;idea&rdquo;?&mdash;gave her an
      extraordinary large assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had touched, however, the treasure of his own case&mdash;his terrible
      own case that began to live again at once by the force of her talking of
      hers, and which could always all cluster about his great asseveration.
      &ldquo;No, no, never, never; I had never seen her then and didn&rsquo;t dream of her;
      so that when you yourself began to be harsh and sharp with me, and to seem
      to want to quarrel, I could have but one idea&mdash;which was an
      appearance you didn&rsquo;t in the least, as I saw it then, account for or
      disprove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An appearance&mdash;?&rdquo; Kate desired, as with high astonishment, to know
      which one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How <i>shouldn&rsquo;t</i> I have supposed you really to care for Bill Frankle?&mdash;as
      thoroughly believing the motive of your claim for my money to be its help
      to your marrying him, since you couldn&rsquo;t marry me. I was only surprised
      when, time passing, I made out that that hadn&rsquo;t happened; and perhaps,&rdquo; he
      added the next instant with something of a conscious lapse from the finer
      style, &ldquo;hadn&rsquo;t been in question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had listened to this only staring, and she was silent after he had
      said it, so silent for some instants that while he considered her
      something seemed to fail him, much as if he had thrown out his foot for a
      step and not found the place to rest it. He jerked round to the window
      again, and then she answered, but without passion unless it was that of
      her weariness for something stupid and forgiven in him, &ldquo;Oh, the blind,
      the pitiful folly!&rdquo;&mdash;to which, as it might perfectly have applied to
      her own behaviour, he returned nothing. She had moreover at once gone on.
      &ldquo;Have it then that there wasn&rsquo;t much to do&mdash;between your finding that
      you loathed me for another woman or discovering only, when it came to the
      point, that you loathed me quite enough for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Which, as she put it in that immensely effective fashion, he recognised
      that he must just unprotestingly and not so very awkwardly&mdash;not so <i>very!</i>&mdash;take
      from her; since, whatever he had thus come to her for, it wasn&rsquo;t to
      perjure himself with any pretence that, &ldquo;another woman&rdquo; or no other woman,
      he hadn&rsquo;t, for years and years, abhorred her. Now he was taking tea with
      her&mdash;or rather, literally, seemed not to be; but this made no
      difference, and he let her express it as she would while he distinguished
      a man he knew, Charley Coote, outside on the Parade, under favour of the
      empty hour and one of the flaring lamps, making up to a young woman with
      whom (it stuck out grotesquely in his manner) he had never before
      conversed. Dodd&rsquo;s own position was that of acquiescing in this recall of
      what had so bitterly been&mdash;but he hadn&rsquo;t come back to her, of
      himself, to stir up, to recall or to recriminate, and for <i>her</i> it
      could but be the very lesson of her whole present act that if she touched
      anything she touched everything. Soon enough she <i>was</i> indeed, and
      all overwhelmingly, touching everything&mdash;with a hand of which the
      boldness grew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t let <i>that</i>, even, make a difference in what I wanted&mdash;which
      was all,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and had only and passionately been, to take care of
      you. I had <i>no</i> money whatever&mdash;nothing then of my own, not a
      penny to come by anyhow; so it wasn&rsquo;t with mine I could do it. But I could
      do it with yours,&rdquo; she amazingly wound up&mdash;&ldquo;if I could once get yours
      out of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He faced straight about again&mdash;his eyebrows higher than they had ever
      been in his life. &ldquo;Mine? What penny of it was mine? What scrap beyond a
      bare, mean little living had I ever pretended to have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held herself still a minute, visibly with force; only her eyes
      consciously attached to the seat of a chair the back of which her hands,
      making it tilt toward her a little, grasped as for support. &ldquo;You pretended
      to have enough to marry me&mdash;and that was all I afterward claimed of
      you when you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was on the point of retorting that he had absolutely pretended to
      nothing&mdash;least of all to the primary desire that such a way of
      stating it fastened on him; he was on the point for ten seconds of giving
      her full in the face: &ldquo;I never <i>had</i> any such dream till you yourself&mdash;infatuated
      with me as, frankly, you on the whole appeared to be&mdash;got round me
      and muddled me up and made me behave as if in a way that went against the
      evidence of my senses.&rdquo; But he was to feel as quickly that, whatever the
      ugly, the spent, the irrecoverable truth, he might better have bitten his
      tongue off: there beat on him there this strange and other, this so
      prodigiously different beautiful and dreadful truth that no far
      remembrance and no abiding ache of his own could wholly falsify, and that
      was indeed all out with her next words. &ldquo;That&mdash;<i>using</i> it for
      you and using you yourself for your own future&mdash;was my motive. I&rsquo;ve
      led my life, which has been an affair, I assure you; and, as I&rsquo;ve told you
      without your quite seeming to understand, I&rsquo;ve brought everything fivefold
      back to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The perspiration broke out on his forehead. &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s mine?&rdquo; he
      quavered as for the deep piercing pain of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything!&rdquo; said Kate Cookham.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it told him how she had loved him&mdash;but with the tremendous effect
      at once of its only glaring out at him from the whole thing that it was
      verily she, a thousand times over, who, in the exposure of his youth and
      his vanity, had, on the bench of desolation, the scene of yesterday&rsquo;s own
      renewal, left for him no forward steps to take. It hung there for him
      tragically vivid again, the hour she had first found him sequestered and
      accessible after making his acquaintance at his shop. And from this, by a
      succession of links that fairly clicked to his ear as with their perfect
      fitting, the fate and the pain and the payment of others stood together in
      a great grim order. Everything there then was <i>his</i>&mdash;to make him
      ask what had been Nan&rsquo;s, poor Nan&rsquo;s of the constant question of whether he
      need have collapsed. She was before him, she was between them, his little
      dead dissatisfied wife; across all whose final woe and whose lowly grave
      he was to reach out, it appeared, to take gifts. He saw them too, the
      gifts; saw them&mdash;she bristled with them&mdash;in his actual
      companion&rsquo;s brave and sincere and authoritative figure, her strangest of
      demonstrations. But the other appearance was intenser, as if their ghost
      had waved wild arms; so that half a minute hadn&rsquo;t passed before the one
      poor thing that remained of Nan, and that yet thus became a quite mighty
      and momentous poor thing, was sitting on his lips as for its sole
      opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you give me your word of honour that I mightn&rsquo;t, under decent advice,
      have defied you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It made her turn very white; but now that she had said what she <i>had</i>
      said she could still hold up her head. &ldquo;Certainly you might have defied
      me, Herbert Dodd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would have told me you had no legal case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, if she was pale she was bold. &ldquo;You talk of decent advice&mdash;!&rdquo;
       She broke off, there was too much to say, and all needless. What she said
      instead was: &ldquo;They would have told you I had nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t so much as ask,&rdquo; her sad visitor remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you didn&rsquo;t so much as ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t be so outrageously vulgar,&rdquo; he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> could, by God&rsquo;s help!&rdquo; said Kate Cookham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; He had found at his command a tone that made him feel more
      gentlemanlike than he had ever felt in his life or should doubtless ever
      feel again. It might have been enough&mdash;but somehow as they stood
      there with this immense clearance between them it wasn&rsquo;t. The clearance
      was like a sudden gap or great bleak opening through which there blew upon
      them a deadly chill. Too many things had fallen away, too many new rolled
      up and over him, and they made something within shake him to his base. It
      upset the full vessel, and though she kept her eyes on him he let that
      consequence come, bursting into tears, weakly crying there before her even
      as he had cried to himself in the hour of his youth when she had made him
      groundlessly fear. She turned away then&mdash;<i>that</i> she couldn&rsquo;t
      watch, and had presently flung herself on the sofa and, all responsively
      wailing, buried her own face on the cushioned arm. So for a minute their
      smothered sobs only filled the room. But he made out, through this
      disorder, where he had put down his hat; his stick and his new
      tan-coloured gloves&mdash;they had cost two-and-thruppence and would have
      represented sacrifices&mdash;were on the chair beside it He picked these
      articles up and all silently and softly&mdash;gasping, that is, but quite
      on tiptoe&mdash;reached the door and let himself out.

    <h2>
      VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Off there on the bench of desolation a week later she made him a more
      particular statement, which it had taken the remarkably tense interval to
      render possible. After leaving her at the hotel that last Sunday he had
      gone forth in his reaggravated trouble and walked straight before him, in
      the teeth of the west wind, close to the iron rails of the stretched
      Marina and with his telltale face turned from persons occasionally met,
      and toward the surging sea. At the Land&rsquo;s End, even in the confirmed
      darkness and the perhaps imminent big blow, his immemorial nook, small
      shelter as it yielded, had again received him; and it was in the course of
      this heedless session, no doubt, where the agitated air had nothing to add
      to the commotion within him, that he began to look his extraordinary
      fortune a bit straighter in the face and see it confess itself at once a
      fairy-tale and a nightmare That, visibly, confoundingly, she was still
      attached to him (attached in fact was a mild word!) and that the
      unquestionable proof of it was in this offered pecuniary salve, of the
      thickest composition, for his wounds and sores and shames&mdash;these
      things were the fantastic fable, the tale of money in handfuls, that he
      seemed to have only to stand there and swallow and digest and feel himself
      full-fed by; but the whole of the rest was nightmare, and most of all
      nightmare his having thus to thank one through whom Nan and his little
      girls had known torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      He didn&rsquo;t care for himself now, and this unextinguished and apparently
      inextinguishable charm by which he had held her was a fact incredibly
      romantic; but he gazed with a longer face than he had ever had for
      anything in the world at his potential acceptance of a great bouncing
      benefit from the person he intimately, if even in a manner indirectly,
      associated with the conditions to which his lovely wife and his children
      (who would have been so lovely too) had pitifully succumbed. He had
      accepted the social relation&mdash;which meant he had taken even that on
      trial&mdash;without knowing what it so dazzlingly masked; for a social
      relation it had become with a vengeance when it drove him about the place
      as now at his hours of freedom (and he actually and recklessly took, all
      demoralised and unstrung and unfit either for work or for anything else,
      other liberties that would get him into trouble) under this queer torment
      of irreconcilable things, a bewildered consciousness of tenderness and
      patience and cruelty, of great evident mystifying facts that were as
      little to be questioned as to be conceived or explained, and that were yet
      least, withal, to be lost sight of.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that Sunday night he had wandered wild, incoherently ranging and
      throbbing, but this became the law of his next days as well, since he
      lacked more than ever all other resort or refuge and had nowhere to carry,
      to deposit, or contractedly let loose and lock up, as it were, his swollen
      consciousness, which fairly split in twain the raw shell of his sordid
      little boarding-place. The arch of the sky and the spread of sea and shore
      alone gave him space; he could roam with himself anywhere, in short, far
      or near&mdash;he could only never take himself back. That certitude&mdash;that
      this was impossible to him even should she wait there among her plushes
      and bronzes ten years&mdash;was the thing he kept closest clutch of; it
      did wonders for what he would have called his self-respect. Exactly as he
      had left her so he would stand off&mdash;even though at moments when he
      pulled up sharp somewhere to put himself an intensest question his heart
      almost stood still. The days of the week went by, and as he had left her
      she stayed; to the extent, that is, of his having neither sight nor sound
      of her, and of the failure of every sign. It took nerve, he said, not to
      return to her, even for curiosity&mdash;since how, after all, in the name
      of wonder, had she invested the fruits of her extortion to such advantage,
      there being no chapter of all the obscurity of the years to beat that for
      queer-ness? But he dropped, tired to death, on benches, half a dozen times
      an evening&mdash;exactly on purpose to recognise that the nerve required
      was just the nerve he had.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the days without a token from her multiplied he came in as well for
      hours&mdash;and these indeed mainly on the bench of desolation&mdash;of
      sitting stiff and stark in presence of the probability that he had lost
      everything for ever. When he passed the Royal he never turned an eyelash,
      and when he met Captain Roper on the Front, three days after having been
      introduced to him, he &ldquo;cut him dead&rdquo;&mdash;another privileged consequence
      of a social relation&mdash;rather than seem to himself to make the
      remotest approach to the question of whether Miss Cookham had left
      Properley. He had cut people in the days of his life before, just as he
      had come to being himself cut&mdash;since there had been no time for him
      wholly without one or other face of that necessity&mdash;but had never
      effected such a severance as of this rare connection, which helped to give
      him thus the measure of his really precious sincerity. If he had lost what
      had hovered before him he had lost it, his only tribute to which
      proposition was to grind his teeth with one of those &ldquo;scrunches,&rdquo; as he
      would have said, of which the violence fairly reached his ear. It wouldn&rsquo;t
      make him lift a finger, and in fact if Kate had simply taken herself off
      on the Tuesday or the Wednesday she would have been reabsorbed again into
      the darkness from which she had emerged&mdash;and no lifting of fingers,
      the unspeakable chapter closed, would evermore avail. That at any rate was
      the kind of man he still was&mdash;even after all that had come and gone,
      and even if for a few dazed hours certain things had seemed pleasant. The
      dazed hours had passed, the surge of the old bitterness had dished him
      (shouldn&rsquo;t he have been shamed if it hadn&rsquo;t?), and he might sit there as
      before, as always, with nothing at all on earth to look to. He had
      therefore wrongfully believed himself to be degraded; and the last word
      about him would be that he <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> then, it appeared, sink to
      vulgarity as he had tried to let his miseries make him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet on the next Sunday morning, face to face with him again at the
      Land&rsquo;s End, what she very soon came to was: &ldquo;As if I believed you didn&rsquo;t
      <i>know</i> by what cord you hold me!&rdquo; Absolutely too, and just that
      morning in fact, above all, he wouldn&rsquo;t, he quite couldn&rsquo;t have taken his
      solemn oath that he hadn&rsquo;t a sneaking remnant, as he might have put it to
      himself&mdash;a remnant of faith in tremendous things still to come of
      their interview. The day was sunny and breezy, the sea of a cold purple;
      he wouldn&rsquo;t go to church as he mostly went of Sunday mornings, that being
      in its way too a social relation&mdash;and not least when
      two-and-thruppenny tan-coloured gloves were new; which indeed he had the
      art of keeping them for ages. Yet he would dress himself as he scarce
      mustered resources for even to figure on the fringe of Society, local and
      transient, at St. Bernard&rsquo;s, and in this trim he took his way westward;
      occupied largely, as he went, it might have seemed to any person pursuing
      the same course and happening to observe him, in a fascinated study of the
      motions of his shadow, the more or less grotesque shape projected, in
      front of him and mostly a bit to the right, over the blanched asphalt of
      the Parade and dandling and dancing at such a rate, shooting out and then
      contracting, that, viewed in themselves, its eccentricities might have
      formed the basis of an interesting challenge: &ldquo;Find the state of mind,
      guess the nature of the agitation, possessing the person so remarkably
      represented!&rdquo; Herbert Dodd, for that matter, might have been himself
      attempting to make by the sun&rsquo;s sharp aid some approach to his immediate
      horoscope.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had at any rate been thus put before him that the dandling and dancing
      of his image occasionally gave way to perfect immobility, when he stopped
      and kept his eyes on it. &ldquo;Suppose she should come, suppose she <i>should!</i>&rdquo;
       it is revealed at least to ourselves that he had at these moments audibly
      breathed&mdash;breathed with the intensity of an arrest between hope and
      fear. It had glimmered upon him from early, with the look of the day,
      that, given all else that could happen, this would be rather, as he put
      it, in her line; and the possibility lived for him, as he proceeded, to
      the tune of a suspense almost sickening. It was, from one small stage of
      his pilgrimage to another, the &ldquo;For ever, never!&rdquo; of the sentimental case
      the playmates of his youth used to pretend to settle by plucking the
      petals of a daisy. But it came to his truly turning faint&mdash;so &ldquo;queer&rdquo;
       he felt&mdash;when, at the gained point of the long stretch from which he
      could always tell, he arrived within positive sight of his immemorial
      goal. His seat was taken and she was keeping it for him&mdash;it could
      only be <i>she</i> there in possession; whereby it shone out for Herbert
      Dodd that if he hadn&rsquo;t been quite sure of her recurrence she had at least
      been quite sure of his. <i>That</i> pulled him up to some purpose, where
      recognition began for them&mdash;or to the effect, in other words, of his
      pausing to judge if he could bear, for the sharpest note of their
      intercourse, this inveterate demonstration of her making him do what she
      liked. What settled the question for him then&mdash;and just while they
      avowedly watched each other, over the long interval, before closing, as
      if, on either side, for the major advantage&mdash;what settled it was this
      very fact that what she liked she liked so terribly. If it were simply to
      &ldquo;use&rdquo; him, as she had said the last time, and no matter to the profit of
      which of them she called it, one might let it go for that; since it could
      make her wait over, day after day, in that fashion, and with such a
      spending of money, on the hazard of their meeting again. How could she be
      the least sure he would ever again consent to it after the proved action
      on him, a week ago, of her last monstrous honesty? It was indeed
      positively as if he were now himself putting this influence&mdash;and for
      their common edification&mdash;to the supreme, to the finest test. He had
      a sublime, an ideal flight, which lasted about a minute. &ldquo;Suppose, now
      that I see her there and what she has taken so characteristically for
      granted, suppose I just show her that she <i>hasn&rsquo;t</i> only confidently
      to wait or whistle for me, and that the length of my leash is greater than
      she measures, and that everything&rsquo;s impossible always?&mdash;show it by
      turning my back on her now and walking straight away. She won&rsquo;t be able
      not to understand <i>that!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing had passed, across their distance, but the mute apprehension of
      each on the part of each; the whole expanse, at the church hour, was void
      of other life (he had scarce met a creature on his way from end to end),
      and the sun-seasoned gusts kept brushing the air and all the larger
      prospect clean. It was through this beautiful lucidity that he watched her
      watch him, as it were&mdash;watch him for what he would do. Neither moved
      at this high tension; Kate Cookham, her face fixed on him, only waited
      with a stiff appearance of leaving him, not for dignity but&mdash;to an
      effect of even deeper perversity&mdash;for kindness, free to choose. It
      yet somehow affected him at present, this attitude, as a gage of her <i>knowing
      too</i>&mdash;knowing, that is, that he wasn&rsquo;t really free, that this was
      the thinnest of vain parades, the poorest of hollow heroics, that his
      need, his solitude, his suffered wrong, his exhausted rancour, his
      foredoomed submission to any shown interest, all hung together too heavy
      on him to let the weak wings of his pride do more than vaguely tremble.
      They couldn&rsquo;t, they didn&rsquo;t carry him a single beat further away; according
      to which he stood rooted, neither retreating nor advancing, but presently
      correcting his own share of the bleak exchange by looking off at the sea.
      Deeply conscious of the awkwardness this posture gave him, he yet clung to
      it as the last shred of his honour, to the clear argument that it was one
      thing for him to have felt beneath all others, the previous days, that she
      was to be counted on, but quite a different for her to have felt that <i>he</i>
      was. His checked approach, arriving thus at no term, could in these odd
      conditions have established that he wasn&rsquo;t only if Kate Cookham had, as
      either of them might have said, taken it so&mdash;if she had given up the
      game at last by rising, by walking away and adding to the distance between
      them, and he had then definitely let her vanish into space. It became a
      fact that when she did finally rise&mdash;though after how long our record
      scarce takes on itself to say&mdash;it was not to confirm their separation
      but to put an end to it; and this by slowly approaching him till she had
      come within earshot He had wondered, once aware of it in spite of his
      averted face, what she would say and on what note, as it were, she would
      break their week&rsquo;s silence; so that he had to recognise anew, her voice
      reaching him, that remarkable quality in her which again and again came up
      for him as her art.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are twelve hundred and sixty pounds, to be definite, but I have it
      all down for you&mdash;and you&rsquo;ve only to draw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They lost themselves, these words, rare and exquisite, in the wide bright
      genial medium and the Sunday stillness, but even while that occurred and
      he was gaping for it she was herself there, in her battered ladylike
      truth, to answer for them, to represent them, and, if a further grace than
      their simple syllabled beauty were conceivable, almost embarrassingly to
      cause them to materialise. Yes, she let her smart and tight little
      reticule hang as if it bulged, beneath its clasp, with the whole
      portentous sum, and he felt himself glare again at this vividest of her
      attested claims. She might have been ready, on the spot, to open the store
      to the plunge of his hand, or, with the situation otherwise conceived, to
      impose on his pauperised state an acceptance of alms on a scale
      unprecedented in the annals of street charity. Nothing so much counted for
      him, however, neither grave numeral nor elegant fraction, as the short,
      rich, rounded word that the breeze had picked up as it dropped and seemed
      now to blow about between them. &ldquo;To draw&mdash;to draw?&rdquo; Yes, he gaped it
      as if it had no sense; the fact being that even while he did so he was
      reading into her use of the term more romance than any word in the
      language had ever had for him. He, Herbert Dodd, was to live to &ldquo;draw,&rdquo;
       like people, scarce hampered by the conditions of earth, whom he had
      remotely and circuitously heard about, and in fact when he walked back
      with her to where she had been sitting it was very much, for his strained
      nerves, as if the very bench of desolation itself were to be the scene of
      that exploit and he mightn&rsquo;t really live till he reached it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had sat down together she did press the spring of her reticule,
      from which she took, not a handful of gold nor a packet of crisp notes,
      but an oblong sealed letter, which she had thus waited on him, she
      remarked, on purpose to deliver, and which would certify, with sundry
      particulars, to the credit she had opened for him at a London bank. He
      received it without looking at it&mdash;he held it, in the same manner,
      conspicuous and unassimilated, for most of the rest of the immediate time,
      appearing embarrassed with it, nervously twisting and flapping it, yet
      thus publicly retaining it even while aware, beneath everything, of the
      strange, the quite dreadful, wouldn&rsquo;t it be? engagement that such inaction
      practically stood for. He could accept money to that amount, yes&mdash;but
      not for nothing in return. For what then in return? He kept asking himself
      for what, while she said other things and made above all, in her high,
      shrewd, successful way the point that, no, he needn&rsquo;t pretend that his
      conviction of her continued personal interest in him wouldn&rsquo;t have tided
      him oyer any question besetting him since their separation. She put it to
      him that the deep instinct of where he should at last find her must
      confidently have worked for him, since she confessed to her instinct of
      where she should find <i>him</i>; which meant&mdash;oh it came home to him
      as he fingered his sealed treasure!&mdash;neither more nor less than that
      she had now created between them an equality of experience. He wasn&rsquo;t to
      have done all the suffering, <i>she</i> was to have &ldquo;been through&rdquo; things
      he couldn&rsquo;t even guess at; and, since he was bargaining away his right
      ever again to allude to the unforgettable, so much there was of it, what
      her tacit proposition came to was that they were &ldquo;square&rdquo; and might start
      afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      He didn&rsquo;t take up her charge, as his so compromised &ldquo;pride&rdquo; yet in a
      manner prompted him, that he had enjoyed all the week all those elements
      of ease about her; the most he achieved for that was to declare, with an
      ingenuity contributing to float him no small distance further, that of
      course he had turned up at their old place of tryst, which had been,
      through the years, the haunt of his solitude and the goal of his walk any
      Sunday morning that seemed too beautiful for church; but that he hadn&rsquo;t in
      the least built on her presence there&mdash;since that supposition gave
      him, she would understand, wouldn&rsquo;t she? the air, disagreeable to him, of
      having come in search of her. Her quest of himself, once he had been
      seated there, would have been another matter&mdash;but in short &ldquo;Of course
      after all you did come to me, just now, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He felt himself, too,
      lamely and gracelessly grin, as for the final kick of his honour, in
      confirmation of the record that he had then yielded but to her humility.
      Her humility became for him at this hour and to this tune, on the bench of
      desolation, a quantity more prodigious and even more mysterious than that
      other guaranteed quantity the finger-tips of his left hand could feel the
      tap by the action of his right; though what was in especial extraordinary
      was the manner in which she could keep making him such allowances and yet
      meet him again, at some turn, as with her residuum for her clever self so
      great.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to you, Herbert Dodd?&rdquo; she imperturbably echoed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been coming
      to you for the last ten years!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There had been for him just before this sixty supreme seconds of intensest
      aspiration&mdash;a minute of his keeping his certificate poised for a
      sharp thrust back at her, the thrust of the wild freedom of his saying:
      &ldquo;No, no, I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> give them up; I can&rsquo;t simply sink them deep down
      in my soul forever, with no cross in all my future to mark <i>that</i>
      burial; so that if this is what our arrangement means I must decline to
      have anything to do with it.&rdquo; The words none the less hadn&rsquo;t come, and
      when she had herself, a couple of minutes later, spoken those others, the
      blood rose to his face as if, given his stiffness and her extravagance, he
      had just indeed saved himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything in fact stopped, even his fidget with his paper; she imposed a
      hush, she imposed at any rate the conscious decent form of one, and he
      couldn&rsquo;t afterward have told how long, at this juncture, he must have sat
      simply gazing before him. It was so long, at any rate, that Kate herself
      got up&mdash;and quite indeed, presently, as if her own forms were now at
      an end. He had returned her nothing&mdash;so what was she waiting for? She
      had been on the two other occasions momentarily at a loss, but never so
      much so, no doubt, as was thus testified to by her leaving the bench and
      moving over once more to the rail of the terrace. She could carry it off,
      in a manner, with her resources, that she was waiting with so little to
      wait for; she could face him again, after looking off at the sea, as if
      this slightly stiff delay, not wholly exempt from awkwardness, had been
      but a fine scruple of her courtesy. She had gathered herself in; after
      giving him time to appeal she could take it that he had decided and that
      nothing was left for her to do. &ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; she clearly launched at him
      across the broad walk&mdash;&ldquo;well then, good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had come nearer with it, as if he might rise for some show of express
      separation; but he only leaned back motionless, his eyes on her now&mdash;he
      kept her a moment before him. &ldquo;Do you mean that we don&rsquo;t&mdash;that we
      don&rsquo;t&mdash;?&rdquo; But he broke down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I &lsquo;mean&rsquo;&mdash;?&rdquo; She remained as for questions he might ask, but it
      was wellnigh as if there played through her dotty veil an irrepressible
      irony for that particular one. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve meant, for long years, I think, all
      I&rsquo;m capable of meaning. I&rsquo;ve meant so much that I can&rsquo;t mean more. So
      there it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you go,&rdquo; he appealed&mdash;and with a sense as of final flatness,
      however he arranged it, for his own attitude&mdash;&ldquo;but if you go sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
      I see you again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waited a little, and it was strangely for him now as if&mdash;though
      at last so much more gorged with her tribute than she had ever been with
      his&mdash;something still depended on her. &ldquo;Do you <i>like</i> to see me?&rdquo;
       she very simply asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this he did get up; that was easier than to say&mdash;at least with
      responsive simplicity; and again for a little he looked hard and in
      silence at his letter; which at last, however, raising his eyes to her own
      for the act, while he masked their conscious ruefulness, to his utmost, in
      some air of assurance, he slipped into the inner pocket of his coat,
      letting it settle there securely. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too wonderful.&rdquo; But he frowned
      at her with it as never in his life. &ldquo;Where does it all come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wonder of poor me?&rdquo; Kate Cookham said. &ldquo;It comes from <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head slowly&mdash;feeling, with his letter there against his
      heart, such a new agility, almost such a new range of interest. &ldquo;I mean so
      <i>much</i> money&mdash;so extraordinarily much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, she held him a while blank. &ldquo;Does it seem to you extraordinarily
      much&mdash;twelve-hundred-and-sixty? Because, you know,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; he returned with a slight thoughtful droop of his head to
      the right and his eyes attached to the far horizon as through a shade of
      shyness for what he was saying. He felt all her own lingering nearness
      somehow on his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough? Thank you then!&rdquo; she rather oddly went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shifted a little his posture. &ldquo;It was more than a hundred a year&mdash;for
      you to get together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she assented, &ldquo;that was what year by year I tried for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that you could live all the while and save that&mdash;!&rdquo; Yes, he was
      at liberty, as he hadn&rsquo;t been, quite pleasantly to marvel. All his
      wonderments in life had been hitherto unanswered&mdash;and didn&rsquo;t the
      change mean that here again was the social relation?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I didn&rsquo;t live as you saw me the other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered&mdash;and didn&rsquo;t he the next instant feel he must
      fairly have smiled with it?&mdash;&ldquo;the other day you <i>were</i> going
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For once in my life,&rdquo; said Kate Cookham. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve left the hotel,&rdquo; she after
      a moment added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re in&mdash;a&mdash;lodgings?&rdquo; he found himself inquiring as for
      positive sociability.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had apparently a slight shade of hesitation, but in an instant it was
      all right; as what he showed he wanted to know she seemed mostly to give
      him. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but far of course from here. Up on the hill.&rdquo; To which,
      after another instant, &ldquo;At The Mount, Castle Terrace,&rdquo; she subjoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I <i>know</i> The Mount. And Castle Terrace is awfully sunny and
      nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awfully sunny and nice,&rdquo; Kate Cookham took from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that if it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he pursued, &ldquo;like the Royal, why you&rsquo;re at least
      comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be comfortable anywhere now,&rdquo; she replied with a certain dryness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was astonishing, however, what had become of his own. &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve
      accepted&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call it that!&rdquo; she dimly smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope then at any rate,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;you can now thoroughly rest&rdquo; He
      spoke as for a cheerful conclusion and moved again also to smile, though
      as with a poor grimace, no doubt; since what he seemed most clearly to
      feel was that since he &ldquo;accepted&rdquo; he mustn&rsquo;t, for his last note, have
      accepted in sulkiness or gloom. With that, at the same time, he couldn&rsquo;t
      but know, in all his fibres, that with such a still-watching face as the
      dotty veil didn&rsquo;t disguise for him there was no possible concluding, at
      least on his part On hers, on hers it was&mdash;as he had so often for a
      week had reflectively to pronounce things&mdash;another affair. Ah,
      somehow, both formidably and helpfully, her face concluded&mdash;yet in a
      sense so strangely enshrouded in things she didn&rsquo;t tell him. What <i>must</i>
      she, what mustn&rsquo;t she, have done? What she had said&mdash;and she had
      really told him nothing&mdash;was no account of her life; in the midst of
      which conflict of opposed recognitions, at any rate, it was as if, for all
      he could do, he himself now considerably floundered. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t think&mdash;I
      can&rsquo;t think&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t think I can have made so much money in the time and been
      honest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve been <i>honest!</i>&rdquo; Herbert Dodd distinctly allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It moved her stillness to a gesture&mdash;which, however, she had as
      promptly checked; and she went on the next instant as for further
      generosity to his failure of thought. &ldquo;Everything was possible, under my
      stress, with my hatred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your hatred&mdash;?&rdquo; For she had paused as if it were after all too
      difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what I should for so long have been doing to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this, for all his failures, a greater light than any yet shone upon
      him. &ldquo;It made you think of ways&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It made me think of everything. It made me work,&rdquo; said Kate Cookham. She
      added, however, the next moment: &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s my story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I mayn&rsquo;t hear it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;because I mayn&rsquo;t hear yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mine&mdash;!&rdquo; he said with the strangest, saddest, yet after all most
      resigned sense of surrender of it; which he tried to make sound as if he
      couldn&rsquo;t have told it, for its splendor of sacrifice and of misery, even
      if he would.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to move in her a little, exactly, that sense of the invidious.
      &ldquo;Ah, mine too, I assure you&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rallied at once to the interest. &ldquo;Oh, we <i>can</i> talk then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; she all oddly replied. &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Kate Cookham.
    </p>
    <p>
      They remained so, face to face; the effect of which for him was that he
      had after a little understood why. That was fundamental. &ldquo;Well, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus confronted they stayed; and then, as he saw with a contentment that
      came up from deeper still, it was indeed she who, with her worn fine face,
      would conclude. &ldquo;But I can take care of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>have!</i>&rdquo; he said as with nothing left of him but a beautiful
      appreciative candour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you&rsquo;ll want it now in a way&mdash;!&rdquo; she responsibly answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited a moment, dropping again on the seat. So, while she still stood,
      he looked up at her; with the sense somehow that there were too many
      things and that they were all together, terribly, irresistibly, doubtless
      blessedly, in her eyes and her whole person; which thus affected him for
      the moment as more than he could bear. He leaned forward, dropping his
      elbows to his knees and pressing his head on his hands. So he stayed,
      saying nothing; only, with the sense of her own sustained, renewed and
      wonderful action, knowing that an arm had passed round him and that he was
      held. She was beside him on the bench of desolation.
